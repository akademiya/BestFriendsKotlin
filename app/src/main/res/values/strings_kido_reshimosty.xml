Oh Father, who has worked so hard to hold on to and gather us! Please allow our minds and bodies to become one, and please let those of us who have bowed down before you embody your commandments. It will not do unless our bodies, which have bowed down before you, become holy temples.
\n\nWhen we realize that we are the people of hope that you have sought over a long period of time while weeping, we come to know that you are truly in a pitiful position. We come to know your situation of having suffered all kinds of insults while carrying out the work of the providence until now.
\n\nOh Father, who has suffered so many kinds of insults, when we think that you have endured, hoping for sons and daughters of hope even while going through various kinds of adversity, we realize that we are terribly worthless beings. But we have come before that Will filled with awe, and we have come with loyal devotion in order to resolve your grief.
\n\nBecause of that, we are in the position of having had to go the course of the battle yesterday, and having to go it today and tomorrow, as well. We believe that you know that the course we intend to go is a course for the sake of your glory alone. Therefore, please come and be with us at this time. Please guide us to be able to act centered sons and daughters who are spread out in many different places, to be able to head towards a beam of the light of life where there can be joy.
\n\nEarnestly hoping that you will allow your Will to be realized through this people and through all the people of this world, we have prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Beloved Father!
\nToday we must leap up. We are lacking in strength, but we are facing this awesome conclusion of history in which it will not do unless we leap up scores of levels all at once. In spite of the fact that we are standing in a position where we must go though the process of judgment, today we are in a deep sleep.
\n\nFather! We are intoxicated by the world. We are traveling together with sin. We earnestly hope and desire,
\n\nâ€¦ thing to heaven and yet have something left by becoming sons and daughters who are not ashamed, couples who are not ashamed, families that to you, who are the center of the cosmos.
\n\nAll the historical situations are tangled in ourselves today. Therefore, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that, by our having cut all those tangles, and having our center of liberation, you will establish us as beings of joy who are able to bow down respectfully to you, while standing in the position of Jesus friend.
\n\nPlease do not allow those of us whom you have chosen for the sake of the restoration of the Kingdom of Heaven, to become people who live treading upon the ideal of the Kingdom of Heaven. Please allow us to be able to go forward again and again, to sacrifice again and again, and to fight again and again, until we are able to accomplish that ideal, led by the ideal of the Kingdom of Heaven. And we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to be able to endure, fight, and win until the time that we can attend you as our universal father.
\n\nFather! Please take dominion over our minds eternally. We earnestly ask that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to offer deep bows of gratitude to our father who is the center of everything, through a new universal standard of life now, and who are able to be submerged in your love.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

If we, who have been called first, have been established before the universal Will of the entire providence, as elements which are like crystals for the sake of making an external form, please do not allow us to forget that we must live for the sake of accomplishing the purpose of the whole.
\n\nWe started along the way of the public providence today, but even though you cut off all the things around us, we could not go over the peak of sacrifice, and we are disappointed in ourselves, we lament ourselves, and we reproach ourselves.
\n\nBeloved Father! When we go over the peak of morality and the peak of materialism, please allow us to be able to willingly submit to this, even if you strike those things. Even if you take everything we have from us, as long as our lives remain, we must be able to thank you for that, and even if you strike our bodies, as long as our lives remain, we must be able to thank you. Please lead us to be able to become people who are like this.
\n\nSince we want to take the example of the footsteps walked by many generations of our ancestors and by the prophets of old, please guide us. We know that Jesus walked a path like this, too, as Job did, and as Abraham did, too.
\n\nSince we know that today we, too, must cross this kind of path, Father, please guide us so that it will not take a long time.
\n\nPlease let us be prepared in order to go over the peak of indignation which is definitely coming our way, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become faithful servants of heaven who raise up the Lord of glory, by building up an altar of goodness, which we are able to go beyond while being grateful alone even if you scold and strike us.
\n\nBy even going over peak after peak of sacrifice which the enemy is blocking, we will lead the family and go over the peak of the family, and lead the people and go over the peak of the people, and furthermore, lead the world and go over the peak of the world and even leading heaven and going beyond. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will lead us to become sons and daughters who are able to appeal with confidence to you, our eternal father, and that you will allow us true life, true peace, true joy, and true glory.

\n\nFather! Since the responsibility is heavy for those of us who are walking to reverse the situation of the fall, we know that if you do not stretch out your hand and establish us once again in a purified position and grant us recreation, there are no people who could be more pitiful than we are. Therefore, Father of love, please stretch out your hand of compassion!
\n\nSince we want to offer our minds and bodies to you at this time, please receive us, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become people who are able to be entrusted with your Will by molding us according to your internal nature.
\n\nOh Father! Since your lonely sons and daughters everywhere are bowing their heads and calling your name, please be together with them, and since we know that nothing can be accomplished through human strength alone, Father, please take dominion over our minds and bodies. Please do not allow them to become stragglers along the course they must run.
\n\nPlease do not allow them to be losers in the course of the battle, and please let them become sons and daughters who are able to eternally sing of your glory, and praise your love.

Beloved Father!
\nYou have sought us by sending the saints and sages of righteousness, and you cultivated the foundation of our hearts by sending Jesus. Now we know that your Will remains that we must realize your Will substantially through our bodies. Since we know that our individual selves must realize your Will through families, and furthermore, we must raise up all the things of creation to you, Father, please be with us.
\n\nWe are come to understand that building the Kingdom of Heaven that is limited to us is not your Will; rather, there still remains for us the responsibility of having to build the substantial Kingdom of Heaven where you are able to dwell in the realm of all things, as well. We know that it is heartbreaking for you to see that this way of ours, this way of the people who must cope with this kind of cosmic responsibility, is still remaining in the fallen world. Therefore, please guide us to be able to have eternal life by once again taking hold of our inadequate and weak selves.
\n\nIf you lead us we will not despair. We will not hesitate. Rather, we earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will please lead us to become brave generals of heaven, who are able to become individuals whom you can move, and churches, nations, a world and the Kingdom of Heaven, which you can move, by having driven out the enemy Satan in order to possess your life and glory.

\nSince we know that before us lies the historical course of destiny of absolutely having to accomplish heaven`s Will, please reach out to us with your power.
\n\nPlease allow our minds and bodies to be filled completely with your Will alone.

Please allow us to become sons and daughters who act according to the movements of our minds, and please do not allow us to become sons and daughters whose bodies move first.

\nShall we say that the way that we are going and going is steep? Please allow us to understand that we cannot compare our minds with the anguish of your heart, and we cannot compare how we are mistreated with the footprints you have left in the realm of Satan which blocked you layer after layer.
\n\nEven while we go this steep way, please allow a sense of mission for taking responsibility for the Will of heaven to well up in our minds, and please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to accompany you on your course by becoming friends of your sorrowful history even while we are sorrowful ourselves.
\n\nPlease allow us to become friends of your suffering heart by feeling that historical suffering together with you. Please allow us to be able to become object partners of joy of our eternal Father, by becoming friends of your external sorrow at the same time as becoming friends of your internal sorrow, and becoming friends who share your indignant heart.
\n\nWe have come to know that more than everything being a problem today, we ourselves, who are searching around in order to receive blessings, are the problem. We have come to know that if we human beings, who must walk a path a suffering, want to avoid that path of suffering, we will never be able to avoid that path of suffering. Please act to awaken the many people who have forgotten endurance, which wins over indignation and mistreatment, to the fact that without that endurance they cannot avoid any kind of suffering.
\n\nWe have come to know the principle of heavenly morality that only when we go over the peak of sorrow, only when we go over the peak of suffering, only when we go over the peak of indignant hearts, are the blessings of that day decided.
\n\nNow please allow us to hold onto your heart, the earth, and all things, and while weeping, to be able to say, "Father, since your sorrow is my sorrow, your suffering is my suffering, and your troubles are my troubles, please entrust all that suffering to me, and you take a position of joy."
\n\nSince we know that we have the destined relationship of father and child which can move all things, and a love which we cannot remove even if we wanted to, please let us be able to be acknowledged by you.

Father!
\nThe time is close at hand when we have to turn our footsteps towards heaven. We have come to know the greatness of your suffering; we have also come to know what the Will you are planning is, and we have come to know how difficult is the responsibility of the children that you are hoping we will act upon.
\n\nWe have also come to understand that it will not do unless the person who knows your will, the person who will live in the garden you have allowed, sheds tears endlessly for you. We have come to know that when that person goes forth in your direction, it will not do unless he is wounded, and we know that it will not do unless that person goes forth together with you, Father.
\n\nAt the same time that we know that person must bear scars like that on his body, we know that, while preparing for your one day of judgment, he must appeal and lament bitterly without end with a grieving heart in his mind, too. And we know that we must form an eternal destined relationship with you, our father, who has been searching for those kinds of sons and daughters.
\n\nIf there is a person who experiences and feels your heart keenly, and knows the concerns of heaven, by having opened his mind, then while embodying your sorrow and this people`s sorrow, he could not help but weep aloud, and while embodying the sorrow of humankind, he could not help but weep aloud. We know that he will become a friend who is able to share together with all humankind the sorrow that fills heaven and earth.
\n\nWhen we think about whether we ourselves are standing in that kind of position, we earnestly hope and desire, our Father, that you will allow us to become people who at least are able to be overwhelmed with shame if we are not able to establish our reputation before you, our father, who has walked the way of suffering, who is so concerned, and who has worked so hard.
\n\nThe people of the world do not want to go this way. We know that today many people desire and tomorrow they will also desire to go this way in their minds, but they are staying as they are, unable to connect the way with their actions. Please allow us to realize the fact that the responsibility of resolving their situations is not with you alone and is not with any leaders alone, it is with us as well.
\n\nBut since we have come to know the fact that the people who want to take responsibility for this grave fact are very few, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to be able to find and go forth on the path that heaven is urging us to go, and please let your earnest mind flow to overflowing, and please let your sorrowful heart flow to overflowing in our idle minds.
\n\nThere are many people hoping for the blessings of heaven, and there are many people offering devotion in order to become your children, but today, which has come after six thousand years have passed, it is difficult to find devoted people, your true sons and daughters, who want to become offerings to you. Since we are very afraid that we might perhaps become a pitiful group that causes chaos along your providential course, please allow us to become people who are worried about ourselves.
\n\nPlease allow us to analyze on our own, how much distance there is between the ideal original garden and the point we are at with our footprints, which were left while fighting the battle today. And while earnestly hoping that you will guide us to be able to be victorious in the battle for the sake of breaking through the standard of being worried, we have prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Today the Christians who are spread throughout the world are waiting impatiently and longing for the Kingdom of Heaven in their minds, but they are oblivious to the fact that a course of battle remains in relation to finding the Kingdom of Heaven.
\n\nFurthermore, today, in the Last Days, history is changing, beliefs are changing, public sentiment is changing, traditions are changing, ideologies are changing, and hearts of love, which said they would die if they did not have that love, are changing. At this time, we long for an unchanging concept, an unchanging aspect, a being who could not change even if he would, that thing, that garden, that world, that dominion, that leader, that voice, that life, and that environment.
\n\nFather! Please open the breasts that have been closed. Even if there is persecution of the footsteps taken by the Unification Church members, please allow us to become believers who take that persecution not as evil elements which are blocking our path, but who are able to use it as a stimulating action which drives us closer to the heart of heaven.
\n\nPlease let us realize that the persecution is not persecution, but rather an act to connect your heart with ours. Please let our minds feels grief that we have been people who blocked the path of your grace. Please let us become people whose hearts are stimulated and whose sense of mission is burning, who are able to come happily when you tell us to come, and who are able to go happily when you tell us to go.
\n\nIf we have been grateful for the voice that called us, please allow us to be grateful for the voice that commands us, and please allow us to become brave people of heaven who are able to charge into the enemy camp, and to become lords of the heavenly world. Since we know that there will be people who collapse shot by arrows, we earnestly hope and desire that you will guide us to not become people who are defeated or retreat in that situation.
\n\nPlease let these sons and daughters realize that at the same time that there are moments when, submerged in joy, we discuss with our father, on the other hand, there are also moments of crying out in indignation and shedding blood and tears on the battlefield.
\n\nPlease allow us to become able to take responsibility for joy; take responsibility for sorrow, take responsibility for the battle, take responsibility for mistreatment, and in front of the judgment seat of the Last Days, deny the things of history and say, "Oh Father, please raise your hands and bless us. Oh Father, considering me, please bear your indignation. Oh Father, considering me, please bear your suffering and mistreatment. Oh Father, considering me. please lay aside your hard work."
\n\nBecause you have hoped for these kinds of sons and daughters for six thousand years, and you have been searching carefully for six thousand years, Father, we are stricken with awe and grief. We have been oblivious to your gaze as you searched, your appearance as you searched, and your careful footprints.
\n\nNow please let us stand before you, please let us live connected with you, and please let us go the way in which we must search carefully instead of you. After we have gone that way completely, we will be the people who must teach other people, who do not know the way, how they can go carefully and find the direction. And since we are the people who have received that heavenly command, please do not allow us to become people who retreat while shedding sorrowful tears here.
\n\nWe know that many groups are not needed at this time today. This time is a time when we must overcome and go on; it is a time when we must settle accounts and go on; it is a time when we must complete and overcome everything; and it is a time when we must appear just as we are.
\n\nWe have come to know that this way is a way that a complaining person cannot go; it is a way that a person who excuses himself cannot go; and it is a way along which a person who establishes himself by himself will retreat. Since we have come to know that this way is the way of the cross that Jesus went shedding blood, and it is the way of the prolongation of Golgotha, we have realized that this is a way that we must go while wanting to excuse ourselves, but not being able to, and while wanting to set ourselves up and boast, but not being able to, and while feeling anger when being stepped upon, and going on. We are indignant when we think about the saints of heaven who walked this kind of path during the six-thousand-year course of the providence.
\n\nBut more than that, when we come to know your heart is more indignant than that, we realize we are people who have to repent. We know that we are in a situation of absolutely having to repent. All of our hopes are yours, Father; everything we have is yours, Father; the center of our love and our hearts is you; and we know that if there is a person who cannot feel these kinds of things, he is a pitiful person.
\n\nEven while shedding blood on the cross, since Jesus knew you were that kind of father, and held on to you, he was not afraid even of death. We long for his character which is transcendent and calm and even asked for blessings upon his enemies. We long for those footsteps. Where is the prince of victory who is able to laugh at changes in history, changes in daily life and changes in himself both today and tomorrow?
\n\nFather, we are longing and longing. The lord of history, the lord of the present age, and the lord of the future need not be divided; rather, we long for the time in which one substantial being appears and transfers your heart to humankind, for that world, for that garden. A group must appear and a religion must appear that are able to call you "Father."
\n\nPlease allow us to be able to forget everything, to prepare to search for that, and to devote our hearts and fulfill our responsibilities completely. While earnestly hoping that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to not mind any kind of sacrifice, to rush forward in order to pay indemnity for everything, and to stand in your presence, we have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Today our unworthy selves have bowed down before you as a group that has been denounced and driven out. We know that on the path we have taken, heading towards a goal others do not know about, scars from the stones will remain, and we will be wounded. But, Father, who knows that we must overcome and not mind those things, please allow us to realize that it will not do unless we completely prepare ourselves, pledge and determine ourselves to go that way.
\n\nSince we know that it will not do unless at this point we form a true heartistic relationship with heaven, Father, please hold on to us by personally reaching out to us. Please hold us in your embrace of love with both arms. You must have looked forward to and hoped for that so much! Now we can fully imagine your heart, and we can fully imagine your heartbreak.
\n\nPlease let us repent once again for our lives of the past in which we were not able to feel grateful, even though our unworthy selves, who are not able to call you "Father," have received the amazing grace of being able to be forgiven of our sins due to the altars of blood raised up by the many prophets. And please bear with the fact that we have come before you empty-handed, even though we should be able to bring and offer results to you.
\n\nAs you are not a father who requests things of the world, we offer only earnest minds and earnest hearts to you, Father. We have come because we want to offer you ourselves, who are weeping because we long for you, and want to see your face. We came longing for your touch, and we wanted to hold on to your wounded hand and shed tears.
\n\nWe came to hold on to our haggard father, to our father who is overwhelmed by grief, our father who wandered in order to find his lost children and did not mind even though the wounds of his mind and body were severe. If your sons and daughters, who call you "Father" filled with this kind of mind, are gathered here, then just as you found me and called me at that kind of moment, I know that you will not cast them away when they have come to that kind of point.
\n\nFather! The way you told us to go was not a lonely way; as we have gone it, we have found that it is a way of awesome race. And we have realized that the way on which you drove us out while telling us to die, was not a way prepared for us to die. When we come to understand these inner reasons, what more is there we could ask for? We have understood that all these are acts to show us testimonies of the work of our father who worked so hard before us. We are grateful for your having allowed us to be able to even weep tears of inspiration and to experience that kind of feeling.
\n\nNow what did the people who have gathered here come to find? What did they come here to see, and what kind of relationships did they come here to form? We know that the only things to show them are tears and heartbreaking situations, and the only relationships to be formed are distressing ones. Nevertheless, without this relationship, without this situation, we cannot know where to go, and since these people have come worrying whether they will disappear and come to lament as sacrifices to Satan, we earnestly hope and desire that you will hold on to them this moment.
\n\nWe know that if you have children you can hold and weep, and if you have sons and daughters whom you can call by name, "Hey, So-and-so," from that point on, the acts of heaven will lead this people, and that will become a beginning which heads towards heaven, by moving the hearts of the people of the world who are asleep. if in this place young hearts are on fire, holding hands together, and there is a movement shouting out, "Hey, So-and-so, let\'s go work for the Will!," the way for this people to live will open up, and armies of life will come and fight together in the garden of death.
\n\nWe have gathered together longing for those kinds of people, and we have gone forth fighting in order to go such a way, and we have gone forth in order to show that to all people, together with our father, by raising up an altar of victory in that kind of place.
\n\nTherefore, please do not allow this first resolution of our minds to change, and please let us become your sons and daughters whose sincerity and fidelity, which we have determined and want to give you, do not bend. Please let us become your sons and daughters who keep and do not change that resolution or that loyalty as long as the moral principle of heaven does not change.
\n\nWhile earnestly hoping for and desiring this, we have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Please allow a day to come when your heart at the time of creation can blossom again, by having the precious son of heaven be born, and by having him be able to atone for the suffering and guilt of history. And we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow a victorious new garden to begin through him. Since we know that it will not do unless that kind of world is realized, please let us be able to bear this real suffering.

But this way is not a way we alone are going. It is a way on which you have gone back and forth before us, scores of times, thousands of times, millions of times.
\n\nNow we have also realized the fact that it is not you who should pave the way on difficult paths; humankind must pave the way and go forward. Please let us be able to take over the final footstep for the sake of our father who has worked so hard, while going along this rugged path. Since the way we must go still remains, even though we collapse along the way, please let us be able to go, following in the footprints of our father, and taking the example of the bloodstains left by our father.
\n\nWe have come to know that when we offer our bodies, which have been wounded and torn, to you as living offerings, you justify your children before all of heaven and earth and bless them. Since we have realized that we must go as far as that kind of position, please do not let us become exhausted until we reach that point.
\n\nPlease do not let us forget the fact that each time we were exhausted, you offered us your arm; each time we were disappointed and lonely, heaven urged us on; and before we did any work, you had already worked hundreds and thousands of times for us.
\n\nYou have gone and pioneered this way without resting. Please let us be filled with minds that want to hold you with awe-stricken minds, knowing that you are our father who went forth fighting without becoming exhausted for the sake of our individual lives, and you worked hard without resting in order to pioneer this way because Satan, who is opposing this way without resting, exists. Please let frustrated hearts, which call out to you like crazy, explode in each of our minds. Please comfort people like that.
\n\nSince we know that you are promising a great heavenly work and a new world of promise, we earnestly request and desire that you will let us become sons and daughters who are able to raise high before the entire cosmos the glory of victory and songs of victory, by having endured until the end, until that position is established by dealing with those kinds of people.

We know that: human beings have at least a way to betray you and turn their backs on you, but since you do not have a way to betray us or to turn your back on us, you have gone on and on. We dare to say we know well the way of our father who has no need of the word "retreat."
\n\nHow anxious, how serious, how pressed your mind must be! Wanting to become genuine sons and daughters of filial piety, and faithful subjects and virtuous women, we have knelt down and bowed our heads before you. Please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to repent for the past when we were not able to appeal to you, asking to become like parts of garments or like rocks that are able to go the way of the cross.
\n\nThe lonely Unification movements in each area are appealing to you, Father. They know your commands. We know that you are in the frustrating situation of having to urge and spur their footsteps along their way, even though they know the course they must go. We know that the people who endure and remain at that point will be blessed by you, Father, but those who fall away will be accused by later generations, and will lament. Father, please let us have bold and courageous minds, and please allow us to become a movement that remains to the end having endured and endured.
\n\nWe also know that your steps as you go are faster than we can imagine. Your mind is such that if we have done a thousand things, you want to order us to do ten thousand. We know that your mind is such that you are looking for sons and daughters who stand in a position of being able to be helped by you. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become genuine sons and daughters in relation to the Will, and to be able to genuinely receive everything that you have told us today.
\n\nIn order to find you, we will have to become sons and daughters of filial piety, and in order to find that nation, we will have to become loyal subjects and virtuous women. That idea is holy, but the way we go is one of misery. The content is beautiful, but it has appeared as a path of death.
\n\nIt has been a path on which we had to have hope inside even while going the path of death. As you are doing that, we, who are your children, have to do that, and as you are going that kind of way, we, too, must go that kind of way of destiny. Therefore, please let us not become exhausted along this road, have indefatigable hearts, and be decided as the final victors.
\n\nPlease let us become a movement that remains by persevering and enduring until the day when we can receive the blessing, the day of rest when you can say, "You have now won the victory; you belong to me, and all heaven and earth belong to you, who are my sons and daughters." We earnestly hope that you will allow us to become a movement that participates in the suffering until we greet that day.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Until now, representing this people, and representing this Korean Peninsula, we have endured and gone forth on this lonely way while shedding tears. How many thousands, how many millions of times have we called out to you from positions of being severely persecuted and ridiculed along that lonely way?
\n\nWe know that each time we called out to you with pierced hearts, you wept, too. We earnestly hope and desire, rather, that you will please have the sons and daughters who are participating here in this place where you are weeping today, participate in the place of the world victory as well, about which we can rejoice in future generations.
\n\nOn the way in front of those who are going this way, there are many enemies. There are also innumerable spiritual enemies. But even if enemies present opposing conditions spiritually and physically along this way that we are going in relation to your Will, if we have conviction and determination that we will go this way by taking the example of the heart of our father, who has worked so hard, then all of those things will be removed.
\n\nWe know well that the principle through which you established and guided us until today was like that. We have realized that after God overcame sorrow first, he gave that sorrow to us, and we have realized that after God overcame a position of suffering first, he told us to go through suffering.
\n\nFather! The Unification altar, which is centered on the Korean people today, has appeared before this people. It is not by chance that we are able to openly shout out our entire idea through having this kind of environment today. We are able to speak in a free environment while looking up at many people, holding our heads up and holding our chests out freely today, but please do not let us forget that until we came to exist, God worked very hard for six thousand years, according to that kind of principle.
\n\nIsn\'t it something we should be very grateful about, and isn\'t it glorious that we are able to walk like this with God on the site of this holy castle? Therefore, please allow us to act while being genuinely grateful to you. Please let us think that our voices, which are crying out, represent the voices of the people of Israel who cried out long ago in the wilderness.
\n\nPlease bless us to be able to go forward while loving, having become heroes of heaven who are advancing into places where arrows, persecution, and bombs are falling, while carrying heaven on our backs, carrying history on our backs, carrying the Kingdom of Heaven of hope on our backs, embracing the true world.
\n\nEarnestly hoping this, we have prayed all these things in the name of the beloved Lord.

There are many people who worship heaven, but there are few people who say they will take responsibility for the sake of heaven. We know that there are many people who know that the way of heaven is good, but they want to avoid the path of thorns that lies along the way.
\n\nFather! You have toiled for our sakes throughout countless ages. But. today humankind wants to avoid the path of toil which must be overcome in order to go along the true way, the way of heaven. Since they want to entrust the sorrow and suffering of humankind to you, as well, we earnestly hope that you will pardon them.
\n\nToday people of the Unification Movement have gathered before you. Different from other people, we have come to know your heart, but different from your situation, we have done what we want with the way of hope you left behind, and we have resisted offering our entire lives. Please let us reveal frankly before you now at this time our selves that are like that.
\n\nWe are praying that, according to your Will, we can go this road of life, which must be gone anyway. We will have to go the path of death together with you, the path of thorns together with you, and the path of being rejected together with you. We earnestly hope that since we have minds that want to live together with you, Father, you will please take pity on us and embrace us.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will establish us as children who are able to struggle and who cannot deny the fact that we are your sons and your daughters, no matter what anyone says. If we have formed the destined relationship of love with you, and if we have been justified as your children who have that blood relationship with you from which we cannot separate even if we wanted to, we know that nothing at all can deny our relationship with you. Please let us become people who repent of our own accord for our past of not having been able to become your genuine sons and daughters, and who come before you humbly and ask forgiveness.
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will let us become your young children who are able to say you are definitely our father, no matter how dirty and shabby we may look, and who are able to say you are definitely our father, no matter how sorrowful your heart may be, or how many worries you have in your heart, and who are able to lament over not being able to fully offer you filial piety, and who are able to hold and comfort our father.

Father!
\nWe know that the world has gone through a course of history that has no center. There are many Christians throughout the whole world, but in reality, centered on which denomination, centered on which tribe, centered on which family, centered on which individual will heaven lower its anchor. We have come to realize that there is no foundation on which that can happen.
\n\nWe are convinced that the reason the Unification religion has appeared on the earth today is in order to lay that kind of foundation and in order to accomplish the worldwide mission of the new age. Because of that, we must not become people who are pushed aside in relation to the present and future historical courses.
\n\nTherefore, we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to clearly know that we must represent heaven on the earth and become heroes of heaven for the sake of having the power that is able to trample the evil world and swallow the evil world.
\n\nWe know how sorrowful a course the process of restoration is. Therefore, today, please let us realize that the essence that has not died and has remained for six thousand years until now is now in our own selves which represent the Adam and Eve of the Garden of Eden.
\n\nPlease let us understand that the events that happened in Adam and Eve`s family are events that have happened in our families and in ourselves; the terrible situation that happened between Cain and Abel is a situation centered on our own selves; Noah`s family also represented our own selves; after Abraham, Moses, and Jesus until now all the events of the course of history are miserable events of history that should have happened to ourselves.
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will let us clearly understand at this time that it will not do unless we acknowledge that we are beings who must remain as substantial beings of resurrection which have the real power of resurrection even if we experience death in that tragic history.
\n\nBecause we know that Jesus came to this earth and passed through that kind of historical destiny, please let us be convinced that it will not do unless we hold the supremacy of victory which is able to do that in order to become his successors, and in order to inherit his destined relationship. And we earnestly hope and desire that you will let us become your sons and daughters who are able to determine the position of victory and go forth.
\n\nIn the midst of all kinds of hardships, all kinds of trials, all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of persecution, we have not been ruined. Through all that we have gone forward sincerely centered on your Will.
\n\nWe have gone forth with this restored family as our standard. Therefore, please let us know clearly that now our individual selves will have to pass through the family, too; all the families on earth will have to pass through the family, too; and it will not do unless the tribes, peoples, and nations pass through the destined relationships of families, too, into the nation of hope which you desire, Father.
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will let us become your sons and daughters who are able to build a world of peace according to your Will, and who are able to realize the Kingdom of Heaven of joy. And furthermore, we earnestly hope that you will let all the human beings on earth become your people, and the entire world become your world.

Father!
\nJust as you have related to us with the heart of a parent relating to his children, please allow our hearts to swell with adoration of our parents, while we relate to you. And please let us share together the many grief-filled situations you have had until now from a position where your mind and ours have become one.
\n\nThe day when we are able to hold you and comfort you should conic quickly. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that in the midst of that you will let us be able to be grateful while realizing on our own the lofty preciousness of our father.
\n\nFather! Since, we are people who must go out to the world anyway, please allow us to quickly prepare everything necessary for going out to each nation of the world. Please allow us to become wise children who can go straight towards the destination we must reach quickly. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to be able to go straight to the places we must go, and even though many people rest along the way, we people of the Unification Movement will not rest.
\n\nWe must know the fact that in the place we must go now there is a path of trials, suffering and hard work in front of us. Furthermore, we must know the fact that the swords and guns of the enemy are blocking our way.
\n\nWe know that the more eager our minds are to go straight there, the more we must have minds with attitudes of wanting to act for our father, minds that love our father, in order to easily overcome everything that will appear there in our external environment. We know that without those kinds of minds, we cannot go straight along this path.
\n\nWe know the fact that you carried out the providence for the long period of six thousand years because you were not able to meet one person who was able to go straight on this way, and because the conditions that have to be indemnified could not be overcome. Please let us know clearly that that one person and those conditions of indemnity have been put on the way in front of us.
\n\nJust as you needed a true character and true conditions of indemnity while going this way looking for us, we, who are looking for you will have to have a true character and establish true conditions of indemnity. We know that we must be able to liberate ourselves from Satan; that is to say, at the same time that we become people who are able to subjugate Satan, we must stand in a position of leading all the people, of offering sacrifices to you, and of not being attacked by Satan.
\n\nUnless we do that, we will end up as wanderers who are not able to go to you even if we want to. When we realize that our way is long and pressing, we know we must go straight, and it will not do for us to take a detour on this way that is so far and so pressing. We know that the time is far too short for us to pass over this long way.
\n\nFather! We know that when we feel hearts that are stimulated so that it will not do unless we become completely for the Will, then we will be able to call you our father, and an earnest heart will well up. We know that you are always acting in that position. Therefore, we earnestly hope that you will allow us to become your children who struggle to dash to you with earnest hearts with the goal of resolving grief.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the holy name of the True Parents.

Wasn`t your search for the individuals, Adam and Eve, for six thousand years in order to save the world in that way? We must understand how great your pain is as you look at the sorrowful souls of the many spirits in spirit world. Please allow us to realize that it was your holy mission and hope to liberate all of them.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to realize that only if the day comes when all the people in the realm of the world together have a foundation of victory that goes beyond the world, will we be able to have the restoration of heaven, and the restoration of earth, of course, and be able to welcome the enemy.
\n\nWe must become sons and daughters who are able to love the world completely, and who are able to go anywhere in the world. Until now we have been the Unification Movement that has been fighting, holding on to Korea, but we must become a movement that is fighting for the world.
\n\nTherefore, even if we shed tears, please allow us to shed them for the people of the world, and even though we were born as children of Korea, please let us have hearts which love not just the people of Korea alone, but rather are able to love all the people of the world. Our own individual selves and our descendents, too, must be able to stand as people with those kinds of hearts. We must give our full effort to attend you, to embrace both worlds, and to find a world that is unified ideologically.
\n\nTo the starving people, we will have to give food, for sure; to the people who are in rags, we will have give clothes, for sure; and to the people who are sleeping under the eaves, we must give a place to sleep comfortably, for sure. We will have to go through many grief-filled situations, for sure.
\n\nWhen we think about the fact that we have the destiny of having to find the world that was lost, the nations that were lost, the families that were lost, and the individuals that were lost, we realize that we cannot sustain it ourselves.
\n\nNow we must hold on to the destined relationship so that at least our minds will be able to remain alive, and go forward determined to die. Please allow us to become your sons and daughters who are able to have a view of unification history such that even if I collapse, the world must not collapse; even if I am ruined; the world must not be ruined, and please let us realize that this is what is called Unification Thought.
\n\nPlease allow all the people gathered here to realize that it is not your thought to let the nation be ruined and to save the individuals. Please allow us to realize that we cannot relate to the world unless we become a movement that is able to seek the world even if we have to sell the nation, and please allow these people to be able to have a day in which they are able to do that.

The ideal world is not accomplished in the imaginary realm of ideas; rather, it is accomplished in stimulating, substantial reality. This is the final request of humankind, but we did not really know that it is accomplished centered on one`s family.
\n\nNow the mission that the Unification movement must go forward carrying on its shoulders is a world centered on the family. Burning with the conviction that the family exists for the sake of the world, that it exists for the sake of the nation, that it exists for the sake of the people, that it exists for the sake of the tribe, the entire family must become a group that is able to live for the sake of accomplishing that goal. We must believe firmly the fact that when we begin to act like this, in the not too distant future, the entire world will be completely embraced in the realm of dominion where you are able to love us.
\n\nWe must discover that we are shameful beings in relation to the holy word: the blessing. Our lives of the past were individual-level lives. They were not lives centered on personalities that were related to the cosmic history; rather, they were individual lives which had fallen into ruin. Since each of us must become able conquer these kinds of selves, Father, please bless us.
\n\nNow we are not going forward for any one individual; rather, we must pioneer the foundation of joy of the family, and with that as our motivation, we must go forward to accomplish that kind of realm of love and family which can be shown to the people. We earnestly ask and desire, Father, that you will let us become those kinds of responsible people.
\n\nFather! We know that it is the Will of hundreds of thousands of ages to establish a family that represents the people and to find a Unification tribe in that way. Now we must straighten ourselves and come before you with a sincere attitude.
\n\nWe know that we must establish a Four Position Foundation in which the man and the woman become one and attend their parents and lead their children for the sake of that. We know that this is the realization of the ideal of creation. We have heard the phrase, "the completion of the Four Position Foundation," thousands and hundreds of thousands of times, but we lament that we are people who have not been able to love that definitive content in reality. Please bear with us. Please allow us to feel the stimulation of love that is able to do that.
\n\nWe will have to complete that kind of mission, bring the people and the world along, and connect them with you, Father. We earnestly hope and desire that you will please let us connect with the essential condition of power, by an absolute subject partner and an absolute object partner becoming one, and by making this into the realm of the dominion of love. Please do not let us be inadequate to act before the world and please let us realize the realm of one family which is able to stand in dignity as beautiful and harmonious beings.

Father!
\nWe know that now before us remains the course of responsibility of having to move the families rather than a course of responsibility to move individuals.
\n\nWe know that the Will which the Unification Church is hoping for is not for the sake of saving individuals alone; rather, it is for the sake of saving families. Because of that, we have walked this way with earnest minds that want to be held in your embrace, and that long for families that are able to eternally praise you and that long for you to reach out with your holy blessing.
\n\nEven the people who have not been able to walk together here, and who have left behind mistakes before the Will, must become sons and daughters who are able to stand holding up the value of the ideal. More than our standing in a position of saying, "I am So-and-so," we must become responsible people of both the internal and external aspects who are able to prepare a starting point for the whole by becoming the standard for the construction of the world, and who are able to become the key point of the people with sincere minds which are able to give our full devotion to your Will and hold up the situation of heaven.
\n\nAs for the individuals, we must represent the families from the position of individuals. As for the groups, we must represent the families of those groups; in the case of the nations, we must represent the families of that nation, and we must become families that are able to represent the providence of the world. And we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become families that go forth embracing heaven and earth, and embrace the world, while searching for one family of peace which you can depend on.
\n\nThe more we think that we have not reached that position, the more we realize that there remains before us the course we must now go as families of pioneers. Now the time has passed in which God told the individual, Noah, to build the ark for 120 years. The time has passed in which you anticipated Abel would offer a sacrifice. The age has passed that was through individuals such as when you called Abraham from Haran. The age has passed in which you called Moses individually. The age has passed in which you sent Jesus individually and set him on a public course.
\n\nSince now, rather than individuals, you have called the new families of the Unification Movement, we know that the time has come when the families must present themselves. Please let us realize that the ultimate responsibility that the family must fulfill is that the couple must absolutely fulfill the duty of filial piety and the duty of loyalty in relation to you.
\n\nPlease let us realize that in our lives we can leave behind an absolute new beginning, and that the way to establish the philosophical key point which can prepare an eternal historical nature related to heaven, is the way of a family that has filial piety and loyalty. And please let us realize that this is the hope of the families that must represent the nation and the world.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that everywhere the families go, they will be able to offer themselves completely to you as families that have been blessed at the same time that they praise the love of heaven day by day, while the couple thinks of the Will holding hands, and while struggling to overcome the world stage.
\n\nWe have prayed all these things in the holy name of the True Parents.

\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become children who adapt ourselves to the Will and who know that going out first before the church says, "Let\'s go," is the way of walking the normal path. Please remember your children who have endured and remained until now.

\n\nWhen we think about this, we realize that we are people who are fit to die thousands of times, and even if we die a lonely death by ourselves, we are beings who should not have any grief over that. Each time we realize this, we come to clearly understand that you are always reaching out to us with your lofty, precious grace.

Since our father has gone that kind of way, we must understand the fact that in order for us to become your children and to become your heirs, we cannot help but go that kind of way.

Please let all the things our minds imagine and all the things our minds feel correspond with your heart. Then we will have to become sons and daughters in whom you are able to have confidence, and we must become sons and daughters who are able to go straight towards the Will by being people who are not inadequate in relation to the Will you are hoping for.
\n\nAnd not only that, we will have to realize that it is you who are pitiful and who has hoped that we would shoulder that responsibility in relation to the course of restoration and the road of restoration which could not be gone if it were not for us whom you have found. When we think that you, who are the Omniscient, Almighty, Lord of creation, are standing in that kind of miserable position, we know that it is a regrettable fact that no one can even imagine at all.
\n\nFather! We must arrange our clothes and be able to call you our father who is working so hard. We must imagine that you are our father who is the origin of the value of the infinite world. We must know that the content of your infinite love is eternal and can embrace all of life and more. Even if the way we go is difficult, we must be able to follow and go this way looking only towards the victory which will come to you as the fruit.
\n\nFather! Please let us be able to hear in our minds and bodies your quietly commanding, gentle voice, and please let a new pulse of the life of resurrection well up in the center of our minds. Earnestly hoping and desiring that you will allow us to become sons and daughters of victory who are able to experience and feel keenly of our own accord our new destined relationship.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the holy name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Beloved Father!
\nWe know that there have been so many incidents that have blocked the way along the grief-filled course of restoration. How very much you must have hoped that we could overcome the crises, and how lonely you must have been each time you faced scenes like that!
\n\nWe know that on the path of many crises many people who have gone forth following your Will were not able to overcome and they fell away, in spite of the longing of our father who hoped we would overcome those things. We must realize clearly that no matter how much people may demand things themselves, if that is centered on human desire alone, your Will, will not be realized.
\n\nWe must go forth remaining in the position of the sacrifice in relation to the hope of tomorrow by offering and offering ourselves before you with minds that are always humble. And we earnestly hope that you will allow us your wisdom and sagacity to distinguish on our own lives in which we hope to become offerings from a position of righteousness.
\n\nWe must realize that when we get up in the morning after sleeping, it is not just the continuation of yesterday. We must realize that even if a day passes, it should not be a day lived by habit. Please allow us to have a sharp, high standard which is able to distinguish between good and evil, and please let us feel closer to and more comfortable with you today than yesterday.
\n\nAs we handle each thing, please let us think about the Will and act in accordance with the Will. And please let us know that it will not do unless the courses of the lives we are living always have the standard of living according to the Will.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Father!
\nEach time we greet a new day, each time the morning sun shines on us anew, we will have to hope that day will become a new day centered on the Will, and we will have to become people who are able to yearn for your Will of hope which is like the bright sunlight. We know that there should not be any distance between us in our lives every day, as well.
\n\nWe must go and experience that the way you are going is also the way we must go; the place where you stay, is also the place where we must stay; the place where you are fighting is also the place where it will not do unless we fight; and the place where you are confronting the enemy is also the place where it will not do unless we confront the enemy as well.
\n\nFather! The children who have bowed down here must come to realize where the way they are going is, and where the place they are staying is. Do they have a proper attitude centered on an attitude of going forth to tomorrow? If our father is heading towards the East, are we standing in positions such that we can head to the East ourselves and take responsibility?
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will allow us to clearly know that it will not do unless we realize on our own that we must know where the circumstances you are going through are heading, and we must know whether we are standing in the position of participating in those circumstances. If we are not standing in that position, we are in a state where we must once again follow you with impatient minds.
\n\nThe way of life is not a way we can go at someone\'s urging, and it is not a path we can go because someone leads us. We must particularly realize the fact that it cannot be gone unless one is able to cope with it by oneself. We earnestly hope and desire that you will let us become your sons and daughters who are able to go forth adding the power of life while determining on our own, and who know clearly that we should not stand in a passive position.
\n\nSince we have bowed down before you sincerely at this time, when you gaze upon us, if we are in an evil position, please spur us on, and if we are in a good position, please hold our hands, and please let us appear as sons and daughters who are enthusiastic in relation to the Will of hope of tomorrow. And then we earnestly request that you will let us become your sons and daughters whom you can believe, and who are able to pioneer the position of filial piety and loyalty, by going forth taking responsibility on our own for all the conditions that oppose your Will by taking over your field of battle.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the holy name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

We know that people always need a change, and need an awakening. Since we have realized that in order to be beings who are able to receive that kind of stimulation, it will not do unless we have yearning and adoring hearts and earnest minds. Since we know well that if we do not bring the results which can brighten tomorrow in the realm of the present moment, it will not stimulate you or our own selves and there can be no joy, please be concerned about your children who have bowed down here.
\n\nHumankind are just letting time flow by. They just think that one year passes and another year comes, but we must realize that in that way ten years pass, and twenty years pass, and half our lives, or our whole lives can just pass away.
\n\nThe fact that we can absorb this day today as joy is something to be grateful for, but we must realize that if we cannot link the joy of today to the joy of tomorrow, today`s joy becomes an evil element for ourselves. And we must realize that those things cannot help but become conditions of sorrow, difficulty, and lamentation. We know that joy is not only good, and sorrow is not only bad; the question is where the joy and sorrow are linked. We know that it is important how much that internal conflict matches the circumstances in order to accomplish one`s goals.
\n\nWhen we come to realize these things, we come to think about how united we are with the Will, and how much our joy and sorrow are connecting to the values of the Will as we go our course of life together with the Will.
\n\nWhen we think about the fact that having become a direct substantial being whom you are observing and seeing through this age, we have realized the truth that being one with you, who are the center, is joy, and not being able to be one and becoming more distant from you is sorrow.
\n\nFather! We must clearly realize from what kind of position you have been calling us, and with what kind of content you have been seeking us. Since it will not do for all the activities that are coming and going to be planned on a useless level, please let us become people who start together, go through the process and continue until the conclusion without going against your authority whether we live or die.
\n\nPlease let us realize that in this kind of present environment, since our lives are such that it won\'t do unless we go before you at the end, Father, it is our glory that we are able to become people on our own who consult together with you about everything, who receive your counsel, and who match our steps to your final victory.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.

Father!
\nWe must now transcend this world of the realm of death. We must break through this. When we think that you are not looking for people who just live in the environment of this age, but rather you are looking for people who are able to overcome the environment of this age and remain, and who are able to firmly establish the traditions of the future on the foundation of the present reality, we realize that it will not do unless we become people who are able to overcome the realm of death and possess the realm of victory forever.
\n\nWhen we think about how very much you have struggled in the realm of death in order to find sons and daughters who are standing in that kind of position, we will have to become sons among sons and daughters among daughters who are able to be called by you, and we must determine to become sons and to become daughters whom you will be happy to set forth in your nation of glory.
\n\nAnd not only that, we must become beings who can inherit the entire world of creation and about whom you can say, "I exist because of you, and I can experience joy because of you," and who can inherit your love completely and feel joy. We did not know until now the fact that until such children appeared, the work of our father, who has endured and continued, has gone forward tangled in our background until today.
\n\nWhen we think that you searched while paying the price of such suffering, but we who were found appear to have so little value, we must have a time when we feel such shame that we cannot present ourselves before heaven and earth, and we cannot look up at the mountains, we cannot look at the lakes, we cannot look at the earth. We must have a point when we discover that we are shameful beings who cannot reach out our hand and touch even the leaf of a plant or a handful of dirt.
\n\nWhat is the way we can resolve the grief of our Father who has gone forward with grief in his heart for thousands and hundreds of thousands of years? If there is a way that your grief can be resolved by your letting those of us who are so inadequate lay down our lives as fertilizer, we must find and go that way, even if it is a way of death.
\n\nUntil now we did not know that that way is the traditional way of people going the way of faith. In spite of the fact that we should have straightened ourselves up, wailed until we were hoarse, and followed the course that your majesty commanded, we stopped shedding tears before you did, and we stood in a comfortable position before you. When we think of that fact, we must become people who are able to feel of our own accord that there are no acts more rash and thoughtless than that.
\n\nWe have been told to be patient, to endure, and to overcome. It will not do unless we overcome ourselves. We must be patient, and we must overcome ourselves. Furthermore, when we think that without overcoming our families and becoming subject partners who can overcome our environment, we cannot stand before you, we will have to realize once again that we must become people who are able to supplicate, asking that your son will appear who is able to represent all individuals, and asking that you will allow the age that the people are hoping for to come, even if we are mined before you while staying up all night on bended knees.
\n\nAnd we must realize that the Unificationists who are gathered here must become a movement that offers devotion to you while shedding tears, and saying that a family that can do that must appear. And then please allow us to become heroes who decide the final victory more than anyone else by running the way of suffering more than anyone else.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the holy name of our True Parents.
\nAmen.

Father!
\nYou must become the Lord of our minds and the Lord of our bodies. You must become the center of the entire church. Since we know that there is no person who can become the center, please become the Lord personally, Father. We earnestly request that you will please always be the sign in front on the way we are going by your becoming the standard bearer of the direction we should go tomorrow, and please guide and admonish us, and please encourage us not to become exhausted along the way we go by your always being our center.
\n\nFather! We are not seeking to hurry along the way having received someone`s orders; rather, we have decided to take this way as our destined course, as a way we cannot help but go whether we want to or not, because we know that humankind is to be pitied, and we know what kind of path you have walked in order to find humankind.
\n\nNo matter how fierce the battle may be on the way we are going, even though the arrows of the enemy fly towards us, because we know well our father who has protected us until now, because we know too well you who have encouraged us until now, even in a position where we have collapsed together with your name, even in a position where we are lamenting together with your name, thinking that we are together with you, we are grateful that you have let us walk the way of victory until today.
\n\nWe are grateful for the way of victory until now, but we know that the destiny of our lives is waiting for us, and it will not do unless we go the way of the destined course we must go while consulting together with you and leave behind the brilliant future victory of the Unification Church.
\n\nWhen a person is born on this earth, he definitely is carrying a mission. We earnestly hope that you will allow our footsteps to be filled with the sympathy of people and the sympathy of heaven as we go forward ourselves on that way of our own accord, in order to defend, keep, and vindicate the laws of public righteousness and the will of public righteousness, and not to have a mouth that defends the individual on the way we are going. And we know the truth that this mission is not to seek for our own individual happiness; rather, it is in order to know how rewarding our lives are, having taken responsibility for a historical public mission.
\n\nWe have realized that the way of our lives is unbelievable as we go through time which comes and goes. As for the world we are living in today, because we have realized that it is a pitiful environment which we are not able to cope with, we earnestly hope that you will allow us to be able to run straight as bullets to the goal we must reach by your keeping and protecting the Unification Church members who know well that you alone are our center, you alone are our sign, and your protection alone allows us to proceed on our way.
\n\nWe earnestly request and desire that you will let us become your young children who are more than able to bring victory to the people and to the world, even if we are blasted into fragments by having become shells which are able to leave behind shouts of the joy of victory, having broken through to the target on our own.
\n\nPlease let your grace and love of the ages remain with us forever. Earnestly requesting that you will push us, Father, to become children who are not ashamed when anticipating the blessings of tomorrow, we have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Beloved Father!
\nThis is a moment in which the urgent, final, historically decisive destiny is about to collide together with our personal destinies. We have come to think about the fact that the Unification movement has become a focal point of hope for the mind of you our urgent father, who want to save this place as you look as the condition of humankind who are moaning, while not knowing where to go in the realm of many religions, in the spirit world, and in the physical world.
\n\nFather! We have realized that if we want to save a person who is dying, it will not do unless we enter into the position of death, and if we want to save a person who is on a path of suffering, it will not do unless we go through a course of suffering.
\n\nAs for the Unification Movement shouldering the responsibility for world history, it will not do for us to become foolish people who build a comfortable nest for ourselves, and enjoy that foundation on our own. We have realized that as long as the nation has not been restored, our way is pressing, and as long as the world has not been restored, our way is pressing.
\n\nUntil now heaven has been in the forefront walking the way of the pioneer, and this son has spent his whole life hurrying in order to follow that path. Since now the way I must go remains before me as the responsibility of having to put everything urgently in final good order while looking forward to a good era, now at this age of nearly sixty, oh Father, please take charge of the way I am going.
\n\nI earnestly hope and desire that you will drive out the Unification movement, Father, to become conditions of your shining glory, to become your shining pride, and to become the way that you can leave behind, that you can walk, and that you can go.
\n\nWe know that in front of the way we must go now there are many paths of trials. We realize that not only the American continent is left, but the continents of North and South America are left, the continent of Africa is left, and not only the democratic world is left, but the communist bloc is left.
\n\nThen when we think that there is no movement that is able to advance altogether giving its entire strength in the direction of that way, by straightening our minds and bodies of our own accord and pushing the footsteps that humankind must go, we feel the darkness of the way heaven must go. Oh Father, now these young people have come to know what your Will is like. We have come to know clearly what we must do and the way we must go.
\n\nWe must be centered on the family, but that family must become the representative of the people and the nation, and not represent just the nation, but must become a family that represents the world and the cosmos.
\n\nAnd the love of that family will overflow and go beyond the nation, go beyond Asia, go beyond the world, as far as everything of the cosmos, even to the spirits in the spirit world, and be able to resolve all their grief. Accordingly, we have realized that it will not do unless we have that kind of standard of the family which is able to be admired by all of them who seek to receive the benefit of that; therefore, oh Father, please bless us.
\n\nWe know that it will not do unless we become those kinds of families who go together on the way you are going, realize a realm of the victory of joy, and are able to be praised for having become your sons and daughters of eternity, having established the ideal families you have been seeking, and when we compose poetry about the history that has continued on down, all humankind and not only all the spirits in spirit world, but also God will be able to listen weeping bitterly.
\n\nWe earnestly request and desire that you will allow us to become a movement that is able to offer sincere hearts and that is able to offer total loyalty and all our devotion to leave behind a public way before you day by day by enduring along the way of suffering, enduring in the position where we are crashed into, and enduring, overcoming, and rising again from the position where we have collapsed.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow the time of glory to come quickly which is able to cancel the name "church" with the liberation of all nations, and praise that this is your Kingdom of Heaven of love, and please let this become the Unification altar which is able to give everything to heaven and yet have something left by becoming sons and daughters who are not ashamed, couples who are not ashamed, families that are not ashamed, tribes, peoples, and nations that are not ashamed before the spirits of the spirit world, before God and all the people of the world as well as the day and the age that remain.
\n\nPlease let your grace and love of the ages be with us forever and ever! We have prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Beloved Father!
\nI know well that there is no way but for this son to offer my life to you with tears, while reflecting once more on the historical ages in which no one knew how to comfort you, during the tedious history of restoration which you alone knew about as you waited for the age. No one has known about all the missions of the ages that you are administering while time flows by.
\n\nI thank you that you have protected me on the way as I have gone straight towards the day of being able to straighten out and go the way of heaven which is the duty of your public good by offering myself and attending you and by resolving your grief over having been miserable, angry and mistreated.
\n\nI thank you for having allowed me to reach an age in which the destiny of the world can be decided directly, when I can discuss the world while standing in a position at the summit of the world after historical ages in which I was driven out, and could not help but retreat and which continued until today.
\n\nSince I am going forward like a strong man who is bold and magnanimous, and who does not feel shame in front of you, Father, who are protecting the way where I must overcome a crisis, I ask, Father, that you will protect that way and be proud of me.
\n\nI have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.
