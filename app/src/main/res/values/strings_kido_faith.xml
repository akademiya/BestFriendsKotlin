Father!
\nPlease let us come to understand the heart of Jesus who had to leave his beloved disciples behind, and, going the path of the cross, had to go to the eternal world, and please allow us to be able to experience and feel keenly the heart of Jesus Christ who gathered his disciples together at his knees, and who was so concerned and had requested earnestly to his beloved disciples who had followed him while sharing his joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure for three years.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become beloved children who are able to humbly offer ourselves as sacrifices in relation to the one Will, and while fathoming with our minds and experiencing and feeling keenly with our bodies, please let our minds, which are able to respond to him, penetrate into heaven, and if his mind moves, please let us move together while moving the people of the earth.
\n\nPlease allow us to be able to experience and feel keenly the heart of Jesus Christ, who in the situation of this bitter human world saw all the crowds who followed him fall away, and only the twelve apostles remained; but he could feel that even among them, before long, Judas would betray him. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to experience and feel keenly today through our minds and bodies the heart of Jesus Christ when all that remained of his three-year course of public life, in which he had done many works and believed in the people, was this kind of lonely situation.
\n\nFather! Please let us experience and feel keenly today the aching heart of Jesus Christ who spoke back and forth with heaven while facing the path of the crucifixion. And we earnestly hope that you will establish us as children who are able to become object partners of comfort to his heart as living sacrifices who have bowed down before you, Father.
\n\nWe have prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Oh beloved Father!
\nHow many times did Jesus hope for repentance from the people of Israel, from the Pharisees and the people of the Jewish religion who did not believe in him?
\n\nPlease allow us to become people whose minds and bodies are touched by the course of Jesus who was driven out and pursued and was not able to sleep in peace, and please let us become people who cannot help but feel the heart of Jesus, whether we want to or not, and who cannot help but begin to resemble his heart, whether we want to or not. And furthermore, isn`t it the Will you are seeking and the hope we are desiring that such a heart must appear in our midst?
\n\nPlease let us feel that now we have the responsibility of having taking upon ourselves the course that Jesus Christ walked and the message of the gospel which Jesus left behind, and the responsibility of returning the glory of victory to you, Father, by fighting with billions of satans.
\n\nPlease allow us to become children who have attitudes that are able to stand firm, and who believe in your words of life and your words of truth, with dashing demeanors like that of Jesus, who believed in heaven and stood firm when facing the crowds of all those who had gathered together.
\n\nPlease do not let us boast about ourselves before Jesus today, and please do not let us talk about our situations before you, today, Father. Please lead as to be able to represent your mind, Father, and to be able to take the same position as Jesus. If it is your desire, Father, that we appear without hesitation in front of the people at any time, at any hour to represent the Will of Jesus Christ, then, Father, please come to each one of us, and command us about each thing.
\n\nI earnestly hope and desire, my Father, that you will lead us to become saints who are mobilized in relation to the Will, and who are able to go out and fight representing Jesus Christ in order to realize your Will, Father.
\n\nNow since we shall firmly shout out your Will to all people, Father, please establish us as warriors of heaven, and please establish us as your children. Please give us directions, please advise us, please call us, and please establish us in a position you can be proud of.
\n\nEarnestly hoping that you will love us and guide us, we have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.

We have come to feel in our hearts the history of toil of our father who has been carrying out the providence by establishing the laws of heavenly morality in order to establish throughout the cosmos destined relationships with the life of restoration. Father, please guide us to become people who deeply realize that you have been toiling for 6,000 years in order to establish the world-level value of life.
\n\nSince we have understood that it is heavenly law that you cannot guide religions that do not form relationships from the individual being up to the whole, please allow us to be able to now live the lives that Jesus Christ hopes for, and we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to know the value of the love of Jesus Christ.
\n\nSince we have come to know that we too must have the determination of life which Jesus Christ had, please be with us so that we may drive back the invasions of Satan and be victorious on the field of battle where we can find the value of our individual lives.
\n\nSince we have come to understand that Satan`s accusation exists in relation to our doing the course of restoration of the value of life which Jesus Christ left behind in Jesus` stead, please guide us so that we will not be people who are accused by Satan in relation to the course we are persisting in and going forward on from the level of our individual lives up to the life of the world, and the life of the cosmos.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will allow us to be able to firmly block the accusations of Satan in our daily lives, and to have the determination that we will block it from the viewpoint of history, and please allow us to be able to fulfill that responsibility.
\n\nSince we now know that we must resemble the perfect character of Jesus, who had dominion over all the things of creation, beloved Father, please guide us to be able to resemble the character of Christ. And since we, no matter who we are, are in a position of having to go a course of struggle, Father, please lead us so that we will not be accused by Satan in relation to our lives in society, in relation to our characters, or in relation to love.
\n\nPlease be with us in order to realize the love of Christ who earnestly hoped to realize the love of our eternal Father.
\n\nEarnestly hoping that you will take dominion over us so that we may have the value of life which Christ established, and realize that value on this earth, we have prayed in the name of the Lord.

Father!
\nConcerned about our own present unworthiness, we must of course become people who can weep, but we earnestly hope and desire that you will guide us to become sons and daughters who are able to weep, concerned about the fruits which were Jesus` will. At the same time that we must become people who weep, concerned about the incompleteness of ourselves, please allow us to become people who are able to repent and shed tears having seen the enticements of Satan who shouts and vilifies Jesus, and having seen that the world has become evil and has not fulfilled God`s Will.
\n\nWhile always feeling the gaze of God upon him during the course of his life, in order to complete the course of restoration through indemnity, Jesus offered himself as the sacrificial offering for restoration until the very moment he died. In that same way, no matter on what day or at what time Jesus comes to us, please do not allow us to forget his gaze which is upon us, or his footsteps as he approaches us. Please let us realize that up until now there have been uncountable times when we have ignored Jesus` gaze and his footsteps as he approached us.
\n\nFather! Please allow us to become people who repent about the number of tears we have shed before heaven, and about how little we have comforted the heart of Jesus who came to humankind unchangingly even though we betrayed him not once but even two or three times.
\n\nOh Father! Since your lonely sons and daughters know that the time of world-level judgment is not far off, and the garden of the universal Golgotha is right before our eyes, please guide us not to walk a path of faith which is centered on ourselves.
\n\nSince our lives are not our own, and the lives we live in our daily lives are not our own, and our hopes and desires are not our own, please guide us not to live our daily life for our own selves, and beloved Father, we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us not to have our abilities, requests and desires, all these things for ourselves.
\n\nEven if we go the way of crucifixion in place of Jesus, we earnestly hope and desire, loving Father, that you will guide us to become sons and daughters who finally come to know the unchanging faith of Jesus; who are able to repent, shedding tears in Jesus` presence before the day of the judgment of Golgotha comes, just as Peter lamented in his heart and shed tears as a fellow believer in God when he saw Jesus carrying the cross; and who are able to lay bare what we have done wrong, and weep before you, having taken universal repentance upon ourselves.
\n\nFather! Since we will walk the footsteps of Jesus in his place, Father, please give us the mission of being able to save the pitiful people of this land, and please allow us to walk the remaining way of Golgotha.
\n\nAnd as we defeat Satan everywhere in the world and realize the foundation of the glory of victory, we earnestly hope and desire that you will lead as to be able to attend the resurrected Jesus in our lifetimes.

Father!
\nYou sent Jesus Christ to the earth as the Lord of dominion over the eternal ideal and as the Lord of dominion of eternal goodness in order to narrow the distance which had become greater between us because of the fall of the human ancestors. Please pardon humankind which could not attend Jesus as the Lord who came as the substantiation representing you.
\n\nWe know that it is because of the inadequacies of our ancestors that Jesus was caused anguish, and we have come to know that Jesus` anguish still remains because we are inadequate today. Therefore, please allow us to become able to fulfill your hope that we will appear respectable before all the things of creation by inheriting the precious work of the good shepherd.
\n\nAnd please allow us to be able to realize the hope of Jesus, and please allow us to be able to appear with your life and your love and Jesus` life and Jesus` love. We have come to realize that if we do not become like that, in the future in the world of humankind, we will be unable eternally to resolve the anguished situation of Jesus Christ who came as the good shepherd.
\n\nTherefore, by opening the doors of our hearts, please guide us to be able to hear the voice of the good shepherd who is calling to us. Now that we know the anguishing situation of our Father, and know your lonely situation, and know the situation of our Father who has worked so hard, we are deeply ashamed of ourselves. Oh Father, please guide us not to become supplicating, wretched people who place all our sorrows, loneliness, toils, and suffering on Jesus.
\n\nNow that we know all the secrets of Satan, your inner situation, and the inner heart of Jesus, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will give us the strength to take responsibility for your situation, to take responsibility for the sorrow, loneliness, suffering and restrictions of Jesus, and to be able to fight with the billions of satans.
\n\nFather! Please let us be able to gaze upon Jesus who is working, filled with sadness, and who is worrying about our situation, and please allow us to realize that even today Jesus feels the pain of hanging on the cross due to our heartbreaking situation.
\n\nWe have not known that when we are in anguish while relating to heaven, sorrowful while relating to heaven, and lonely while relating to heaven, in order to comfort us, Jesus comes to feel a greater loneliness, a greater sorrow, and greater suffering. Now, even if our suffering is greater than the suffering of Jesus, and our sorrow is greater than the sorrow of Jesus, and our difficulties are greater than the difficulties of Jesus, please help us to become true sons and daughters who are able to be concerned and to beg in order to take away the sorrow of Jesus.
\n\nAnd we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become able to follow behind the good shepherd and to comfort the fervent heart of the good shepherd. We earnestly hope that you will let us become people who take on the mission of Jesus in his stead and who are able to contend with and fight steadily against Satan, even though the invisible Satan creates distress and fear while attacking us directly in our lives, and we earnestly hope that you will establish us anew as sons and daughters who are able to inherit the life of Jesus.

We know that Jesus Christ, who was sent by you, our Father who had worked hard for the 4,000 years after Adam, came as your incarnation, as the fruit of tears, sweat, and blood, and he came with the mission of having to shed tears in your stead, to shed sweat in your stead, to shed blood in your stead, and with the mission of having to resolve your enmity.
\n\nWhen we think that Jesus Christ walked a path of tears representing heaven, walked a path of toil without a moment`s rest: representing all the people, and walked the perspiring course of his public life, Father, please allow this to become a time when we sincerely reflect on whether we have become people who are able to face that kind of Christ.
\n\nWhen Jesus was carrying the cross on his back and going towards the mount of Golgotha, in the distance there were women who bewailed and lamented him, but Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
\n\nToday, please allow us to be able to experience and feel keenly at this time the earnest heart of Christ as he said that. Since we know that a person who does not know the situation of the cross cannot receive the salvation of the cross, and that a person who does not know how to experience and feel keenly Jesus\' heart when he was going to the cross, cannot stand on the side of truth, Father, please look with pity on your sons and daughters who have gathered here at this time.
\n\nEven if we don`t possess anything, and we don\'t have anything to offer to you, Father, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to be able to become guardians of goodness who, having engraved in our minds the loneliness of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, meet and fight with the enemies who are invading and coming in.
\n\nWe know that the time has come that today we must go over the peak of the world-level Golgotha, and we must shout out to this world, which is like a wasteland, the final appeal that Jesus shouted out in the place called Gethsemane. Therefore, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will guide us not to become sons and daughters who live for ourselves and keep Christ at a distance.
\n\nFather! Please allow us to become people who, while representing the heart of Jesus Christ, first take responsibility ourselves for the difficulties, when there are difficulties, and who first take responsibility ourselves for the sorrows, when there are sorrows, and who, even if we were to collapse having gone through suffering ourselves, if it is the Will that heaven desires, are able to fight and go forward willingly submitting to that.

\n\nPlease allow us to feel the heart of Jesus at the time when he faced the lack of faith on the earth and when he was concerned as he comforted God`s aching heart and was frustrated. And we earnestly hope that you will allow our minds not to just remain at a standstill at this time, but rather to be able to move connected to your heart and the historical heart of Jesus.

\n\nSince we know that in front of us Satan is always acting to block your grace, Father, please allow us to become people, Father, who, by realizing when and in what kind of position your grace comes, are able to go beyond the attacks of Satan and are able to be held in your eternal embrace of love.

Father!
\nWe know that in order to recover Adam and Eve who were lost, after you worked for 4,000 years you sent Jesus to this earth as the person with the external form of Adam. The greater your work was until the birth of Jesus, the greater the source of pride for heaven Jesus should have been, who was born due to that work, and it would not do unless he became the pride of humankind and of all creation. Heaven knew that kind of truth, but the earth was ignorant and did not know; heaven welcomed him, but today we cannot help but be ashamed that not knowing, the earth did not welcome him.
\n\nAs we reflect on the sad truth that the hopeful gaze of our Father, who had worked so hard, had to rest upon poor Jesus, who was lying in the manger, we keenly feel that our ancestors did not have faith, and our ancestors did not have loyalty. Because we know the fact that the mistake of the fall of Adam and Eve was demonstrated by humankind once again in that place, today we cannot help but be extremely sorrowful and feel that sad historical truth in our hearts.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to be able to comfort your sorrow, Father, in place of the chosen people, the people of Israel, who were not able to comfort you in the past.
\n\nSince Jesus came and went, two thousand years or so have passed without our knowing it, but we know that the world of heart transcends tine. Oh Father, who transcends history, please allow us at this time to become able to hold and embrace the heart of Jesus Christ who went to heaven with a sorrowful heart.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow this to become a time when we are able to honor in our hearts the appearance of Jesus at the time he was born, by our knowing the enmity that penetrates and remains on the earth and in heaven until today, and the anguish of the 2,000 years after Jesus came and went.
\n\nFather, please bless this moment today, when we are celebrating that day, and please allow the sorrow of Jesus who came and went 2,000 years ago to be resolved through this one day by revealing the glory of the joy Jesus had hoped for. Since we, who know all the innermost hearts, want to celebrate this day, please allow all the anguish of the past which humankind didn\t know about and left behind to be indemnified because of this time, and we earnestly hope and desire that by allowing us to be able to stand before you, Jesus will be happy, and you will be comforted, Father.
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will allow this to be a holy time when we will be able to find the source of happiness by resolving through us the grief left by thousands of years, and that you will allow what we are offering with united minds to you, Father, to become a historical offering which resolves grief.

Please allow this to become a time of reflecting on Christ, who was born in a position of anguish, offered his life of more than 30 years, and did not avoid the path of Golgotha; and to become a time of receiving his old battles as unfinished works.

Was there anyone on this earth who knew the mind of Jesus? Since there was not a single person who saw Jesus who was filled with apprehension and who experienced and felt keenly the sorrow of heaven penetrating deep into his or her mind, we know that heaven could not help but lament over the people who were like this.
\n\nAt this time please let us be able to sympathize through our minds with the sorrowful fact that not having a single disciple who, knowing the heart of heaven, called him "Lord," Jesus had to go a course of life scattered with suspicion, and furthermore had to meet the end of his lonely life while with suspicion. Oh Father! Please allow us to become people who can fathom the lonely heart of Jesus who gathered his disciples in front of himself and had to tell them that before long his life on earth would end, and he would go to his father`s kingdom.
\n\nIf we look at it in terms of time, there is a period of 2,000 years between Jesus and ourselves, but since we know that the world of heart can transcend time, please bring about acts of direct experience and keen feeling, so that moved to tears by the lonely heart and haggard appearance of Jesus, we can see today his holy image which has exhorted us word by word. This kind of scene is a scene that we as human beings cannot help but long for.
\n\nJesus embraced the earnest heart of heaven, and embraced the entire work of heaven, and came to humankind, but humankind treated Jesus, who was that kind of person, however they pleased, and they rejected him totally. They pushed him into a completely lonely position.
\n\nBut please let us come to know the lonely situation of Jesus, who did not have even one disciple who could be trusted in the presence of the grim heart of Jesus who was thinking that, in order to pioneer the one way to the garden of life, it wouldn\'t do unless he dragged them to Gethsemane and that it wouldn\'t do unless they went the way of the cross on Golgotha. Please let us come to know that even while walking without argument through the place of lamentation, and even though he was filled with sorrow, Jesus could not cast aside humankind who were like that.
\n\nToday please let us be able to communicate with the heart of that time and to relate to heaven while thinking of these truths, and appeal to heaven saying, "Oh Father!" with the heart of Jesus who was in a position like an orphan.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will let these people become disciples who open their hearts and who can believe, and that you will allow these people to become beings who are able to testify about Jesus.
\n\nWe earnestly hope that you will allow us to be able to sympathize with the heart of Jesus, who had to leave behind disciples who did not know how great his sorrow was. with the heart of Jesus, who was in the position of having to end his life without having seen his life bear fruit, in spite of his having lived his entire life for humankind. Please let us sympathize with the mind of Jesus, who was worried about heaven with an extremely sad heart.

\nThe closer that the time comes to meeting the Lord of resurrection, the more hesitant our minds become. As the time comes closer, please let us imagine even more Jesus Christ, who embraced the sorrowful destiny of death.
\n\nWe have come to know that he who died at the seat of punishment, passed on with enmity in his heart. Since we have come to know that the mount of Golgotha that he walked upon was a peak of the tears of destiny, we know that the blood and sweat he shed have lived on in the history of destiny until today, and they are being resurrected and are going into the innermost hearts of each human being.

\nWhat was the hope John the Baptist held in his heart as he preached in the wilderness for 30 years eating locusts and wild honey? We know that his entire hope was greeting the Messiah who was coming.
\n\nHe, who had borne witness to the Messiah, had a destined relationship of heavenly morality such that it would not do unless he became one with the Messiah. By reflecting everything Jesus had in John the Baptist`s heart, John the Baptist should have realized a unity that said he is in my mind, and I am in him; his things are my things; his heart is my heart, and his life is my life; but he could not do that.
\n\nWhen he was imprisoned sorrow and loneliness, from a position of not being able to help lamenting his lonely situation, and remembering that he had raised up his hands and borne witness that this was the son of heaven in front of the crowds at the Jordan River, John the Baptist sent his disciples to the Messiah he had borne witness to, to the Messiah heaven had borne witness to and established, and he asked him, "Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?" We have come to know that this scene was a historical, sorrowful scene; it was a scene filled with anguish which was difficult for heaven to go through.
\n\nThe course of John the Baptist remains in the flow of history just as it was. Please allow those of us who are hoping to find a new belief, who are preparing, while anticipating a new history, to become people who know how to consider things having put ourselves in John the Baptist`s position.
\n\nSince we have come to know through history the fact that the people of heaven rejected heaven`s Will, please take dominion so that we will not become people who follow in those kinds of historical footsteps, and we earnestly hope and desire that you will not allow us to become people who lose the Will that was prepared and refined in the wilderness.
\n\nPlease allow us to realize that today our minds and bodies have no honor before you, Father. Please let us be able to hear your words of advice and inherit the sorrowful heart of Jesus Christ, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow our minds and bodies to be able to embrace the sorrowful, heavenly heart and to greet the new central figure of the new belief, whom humankind does not know.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow this to become a time when we can be concerned about who the central figure is who will take care of this age and which people is the people who will be able to remain in this age, and when we can be filled with sorrowful hearts and long for those who are like that.
\n\nNow the time has come when we, who live inclining our ears to the words we hear and the voice we hear, and who live in concert with that and respond to that, must look back on the path we have walked and come to our senses anew.
\n\nPlease let us go beyond the position of being concerned about our own selves, who are in a position of having to determine whether to live or die, while being in the midst of confusion and chaos. We know that the society cannot be trusted, and the world cannot be trusted, and the time has come that we must be submerged in the world of the doctrine we can believe, and we must come to our senses on our own and be able to form a destined relationship with the world of that doctrine, and recognizing ourselves, we must cling to heaven, and we know that the time has come that it will not do unless we have a revolutionary change of mind.
\n\nPlease guide us to be able to pursue a new self, remembering that we are in such an environment, and please let us become people who are able to greet the appearance of joy, by going over the peak of sorrow filled with enmity, and please let us be able to long for that appearance, to be led by that world, and to harmonize with that world.
\n\nPlease give us the strength and courage to be able to block and fight, and to consider it pitiful that today the social environment is not free and that it is filled with sorrow. If there is a heaven that is eternal and absolute, we earnestly ask that you will give us the power to be able to cast aside the entirety of sin.

\nWe long for the holy majesty of Jesus of 2,000 years ago. We would come to realize that the desolate world lay before Jesus who was conveying the word, and there were people who were centered on themselves and sought to lift themselves up, but through the gaze of Jesus who looked upon those people there was an infinitely sorrowful heart flowing.
\n\nOh Jesus, who looked upon Judaism, in which the religious sects were fighting each other, and upon the reality of the believers who argued with each other! When we reflect on the nature of that era when people struggled to push themselves to the forefront by hiding their faults and revealing others faults, we understand the infinite sorrow of the mind of Jesus, who truly had come to take responsibility for that world and that age.
\n\nWe can measure the heart of Jesus who, in spite of that, called out, "Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you." The ones who had to ask, seek, and knock were the people, the religious orders, and the individuals, but those who had to ask did not know how to, and those who had to seek did not know how to, and those who had to knock did not know how to.
\n\nJesus, who was watching that, was in a position such that it wouldn`t do unless he asked representing humankind, and he was in a position such that it wouldn`t do unless he sought representing humankind, and he was in a position such that it wouldn`t do unless he knocked representing humankind. This was a sorrowful thing, Father.
\n\nThe Messiah, who was sent and longed for humankind to seek him, was instead in a position where he had to seek, and heaven, which hoped that humankind would attend him, had made preparation through the long course of history, but he was in a position of not being attended by humankind. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow this to be a time when we feel the lonely heart of Jesus.
\n\nAs Jesus related to humankind on the earth, the situation was such that he could not help but weep and lament, but nevertheless he hoped that the earth could become such that you could bless it. Please act to manifest the holy majesty of Jesus here before us today, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will let us become a group of people who are able to hear his voice which is commanding us; who are able to adore, experience and feel keenly his heavenly heart which is silently flowing in his innermost self; and who are able to bow down and weep.
\n\nSince we have raised up our hands and have appeared as naked people before you, Father, please have mercy on us. Please do not allow anything other than you in our minds, Father, and please do not allow our hopes, or our desires, or any conditions that we request to be anything other than what is yours. We earnestly hope and desire that you will let us become sons and daughters who are able to live clinging to minds which are filled with your infinite heart, and to live experiencing and feeling keenly those minds, and fight together on the side of those minds. We have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.

Oh Father, who has carried out the providence in order to greet the day of hope you have anticipated and waited for, you could not cast away faithless humankind, and in order to embrace the many lonely groups of people, you gave the blessing of Israel, and led history forward, and on the day that you sent the being you had promised, heaven should have been filled with your glory, and through the rejoicing hearts of all the people, both heaven and earth should have been filled with joy but Father, we know the greatly mortifying historical fact that the sorrow of 4,000 years was imposed on the one person of Jesus.
\n\nHe was born in a stable, and the more than 30 years he lived were so wretched and so lonely, and there were so few places he could depend on. Today we know that Jesus, who had so few people he could trust, died as the leading character of enmity, and was not able to open his innermost heart to people or express his earnest heart on the earth.
\n\nThere remained heavenly advice he had to give, but because the people who had to receive it did not believe in him, he could not say everything, and he died with the sorrow of it still being in his heart. Please forgive all humankind who do not know that sorrow of Jesus 2,000 years ago. Nevertheless, we have heard the prayers, the words of advice and the requests he gave to the disciples he gathered and who followed heaven.
\n\nWe know the mortifying historical fact that the moment when his destiny and heaven\'s destiny met, the joy of heaven should have been created, and furthermore a new kingdom should have been built on earth. But the moment that those destinies collided with each other, joy disappeared, lamentation and anguish began, and the path of the cross of enmity came into being.
\n\nOur ancestors became indebted to heaven, and we, too, are indebted universally to heaven, so we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will pardon the fact that we are a group of people who are seeking our own comfort and who do not know how to indemnify that.
\n\nFather! How many sons and daughters do you have on this earth, who have minds that have experienced and felt keenly your grieving heart, who are concerned about the earth, and who are concerned about heaven? Father, we know that they are very rare. Our Father, who has passed through the ages, counseling our lonely selves while not minding putting forth a great deal of effort in order to save all the pitiful people, please establish a new covenant with us. If there is a heavenly Will to give to these people a new covenant and a mission of the new age, Father, please carry out that work.

Today we know of and believe in Jesus who was born and died in history, but there is no one who knows of and believes in Jesus and his heart when he was rejected and driven out, and wandered to that town when he was driven out of this one and to that village when he was driven out of this one. We have not been able to find in history a person who knew Jesus, who appeared representing the heart of heaven.
\n\nThe people of Israel, who were awaiting the Messiah, had the hope of meeting the Messiah in their hearts, and they struggled and endured through several thousand years, and they anticipated wondering in which age the Messiah would appear. But we cannot help but recall that when that goal appeared in reality, they were fast asleep, without knowing the heart of heaven because they leaned towards the environment they were in and their own situations.
\n\nIf today we have the responsibility of resolving the enmity that has penetrated your heart, as we recall that there was that kind of lamentable history, please allow us to be able to cope with and resolve, in their stead, the sins of Israel which did not recognize Jesus who came. Please allow us to be able to take responsibility for the mistake of Israel which caused Jesus such sorrow and to repent in its stead. Jesus had a life of more than 30 years of sorrow.
\n\nFurthermore, there were the three years of his public life, but who knew his heart and who knew his situation? There was not even one person. And more than that, the disciples who attended him as their master, who shared his joys and sorrows, who were sad together when he was sad, and were lonely together when he was lonely, they did not know, either.
\n\nThe disciples, who should have clung to heaven and appealed with earnest hearts, concerned that their master might go the path of death, were instead in such a state that they were asking who Jesus was. Therefore, if it is the case that there was sorrow in the heart of Jesus who felt that his three years of devoted work were in vain, where could there be sorrow greater than his, and if he felt pain, where could there be pain greater than his?
\n\nThere are Christians who know how to adore and attend the Jesus who wielded power, but there are no Christians who seek to hold onto and live the footsteps of Jesus who was stepped upon and driven out. Father, we cannot help but appeal with bitter tears that among the people of the world many sons and daughters who are able to come forward will do so, holding on to the heart of Jesus who was so miserable.
\n\nOh Father who lives controlling the background of history! We know that you quietly teach us the way to go. Oh Father, please do not allow us to become people who long for the Jesus of the past; we earnestly hope and pray that you will allow us to become able to struggle in order to testify to the Jesus of this age.
\n\nNow please let us be able to sympathize with the heart of Jesus, who should have gone before you, and bow our heads before that heart, and if there is something that Jesus wanted and which would make him happy, please allow us to become able to realize it for him. We earnestly hope and desire that you will guide us to become sons and daughters who are able to be filled with and form a relationship with the heart of Jesus who should have resolved the problems of life of humankind two thousand years ago.

We know that your sorrowful tears remain on this earth where you lament wondering where Israel has gone which used to live within your realm of blessing, and boasted of being the chosen people and boasted of its authority as a chosen people.
\n\nIn spite of the fact that while enduring historical loneliness, you went forward holding on to the chosen people of Israel throughout 4,000 years of history in order to send the one Messiah, they left the Messiah behind and were embraced in the bosom of Satan. We have come to know the truth that because of that, the sorrow you felt as you watched was not a loneliness of that time alone, but it has remained as a historical loneliness for billions of years.
\n\nWhen we reflect on the fact that at that time the chosen people of Israel did not know this kind of fact, today we cannot help but be sorrowful that it is our responsibility to have to reveal the nature of the historical sin as we bow down our bodies and compose our minds, and repent in their stead for that historical sin.
\n\nToday we know the fact, which has been hidden in the shadows of historical sorrow, that Jesus came with the lonely heart of heaven to the people who were collapsing and overthrown and dying, and taking compassion upon them he came to them without holding back even his own life. But the people of Israel, who called themselves the chosen people, did as they pleased to the messiah who was sent by heaven and to John the Baptist who was prepared by heaven.
\n\nPlease allow your sons and daughters who are gathered here today to know that it was not because the people of Israel at that time were less than us, that they betrayed heaven, and it was not because their desire to live for the sake heaven was not as great as ours, that they forgot heaven.
\n\nPlease allow us to realize that they were lacking in hope about the new age, and they had a concept about the new messiah, and they thought that the new Lord to come would be very great, but because the messiah who appeared in reality was too haggard, and pitiful and unimpressively small, they rejected him.
\n\nPlease allow us to consider what kind of position we are in now, and today we commonly speak ill of the historical people of Israel, and like to criticize the situation at that time, but please let us know that there is no difference between the situation today and the situation at that time.
\n\nPlease allow us to have minds that admit that if we had been alive at that time, we would have been the same as them, and if we had been alive at that time, we would have been in the same position as they were. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to realize that we are people who have within us the traces of that kind of historical sin, and that Satan\'s evil influence is stalking our bodies.

Today the course of our lives is a miserable course, and since the living environment is very complicated, we are living in a state of confusion where we are unable to distinguish between good and evil.
\n\nWe know that heaven struggled in this kind of land in order to pioneer the path of one life, and many prophets came to this earth and died in order to introduce to humankind the aspect of a true person, and a true concept, and the true aspect of the cosmos.
\n\nThe time has come when we must long for his idea which filled his heart which flowed out from the sacred image of Jesus Christ who was able to pray for the blessing of all people even though, among all of the prophets, he came to the earth as the messiah for all people and disappeared worthlessly like a bit of straw on the cross.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will pardon that in spite of this being a time when we should disregard ourselves, we have raised ourselves up and disregarded all the things of creation, and we have established ourselves and disregarded heaven.
\n\nIf we want to move towards true minds and true goodness, please let us realize that we are people who are indebted to heaven and earth, and we are a tribe of sin which has been wounded in an inexpressibly savage-looking way in the course of human history. Now since the only things we need are a mind that is able to search for you and fidelity that is able to search for our original selves, Father, please allow us to have them.
\n\nWe cannot deny that the course of life Jesus lived was a path of miserable tears, and we know that each and every page of past history continued on as blood-curdling, bloody battles. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will let us know that we are in the position of the stragglers of universal history who are not able to have anything to be proud of in this age, and cannot clarify anything historical when we establish ourselves. Therefore, since a true leader, a leader who has a true life and a true heart, is needed, we believe that the person whom heaven has sent to humankind is the savior and the messiah.
\n\nBut please let us grope and consider on our own whether we have the constancy, fidelity, and heart that are fitting before him in order to go before the person who is the messiah.
\n\nWe know that in relation to receiving the messiah, heaven is anticipating that humankind will offer its greatest fervor, it greatest loyalty, and its greatest sincerity, and we know that heaven is demanding burning hearts and absolute devotion which do not take sides with Satan. Now we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will guide us to become humble young sons and daughters, who, even if we have not reached such a position, will be able to have at least minds that long for such a position, and who hope for the grace of forgiveness on bended knees.

\nToday, this time is a time that has a historical distance from Jesus. But we know that even though there is a distance in history, there is no distance in the world of heart. Therefore, please do not let us become people who believe in the historical Jesus; please let us become people who are able to know and believe in Jesus directly through our hearts.
\n\nPlease allow our minds and bodies to be filled with awe-filled minds, earnest minds, moved minds which are able to hear the voice of that time which appealed to us, and to bow down our heads before him and feel sorrow through our minds while imagining the anxious majesty of Jesus who spoke.
\n\nPlease let us become people who call you "Father" without even realizing it, and who, without knowing when we do it, thank you while feeling the ecstatic grace of the Lord. Please let us feel sorrow over the ghastly road he went after appearing on the earth, even though the messiah whom you sent was a being whom heaven should have protected and supported, and please let us be concerned over his toil and angry over his anger.
\n\nBy our heartistically taking over today all the things that our ancestors of that time could not do, please let us become people who console and people who comfort Jesus in their stead, and please let us become objects of hope to him.
\n\nHow pitiful a person was Jesus? His mind could not help but lament when he looked at the people, and there was nothing for his heart to do but weep aloud when he looked at the religious bodies. Humankind could not understand his situation of having the responsibility of the providence of heavenly destiny.
\n\nThere was no one who understood his heart as he wandered in the mountains alone at night, putting behind him humankind, with whom he should have communicated his heart, the religious bodies, with which he should have shared his heart, and the people, with whom he should have lived together. Today, please do not allow us to become like the people who follow Jesus without knowing him, and who believe in Jesus without knowing him. Earnestly hoping that you will allow us to become people who cling to his pitiful heart, who are able to weep endlessly for it, who are able to be endlessly concerned about him, and who are able not to mind even the place of death for his sake.

\nPlease let us consider what the situation of Jesus must have been like when he came alone and died 2,000 years ago. In order to save all the people on this earth, even if he would offer his entire self as a sacrifice, and even if he would collapse, he was concerned, and he calmly received those miserable difficulties, and he even enjoyed going to lonely places. Please let us feel sympathy for that loneliness of Jesus.
\n\nWe know that Jesus did not fight in order to realize a personal goal; rather, he fought shouldering the heavenly mission of saving the people of the world who have become sinners and at the same time he shouldered the mission of leading this world which was in the realm of death into the world of heaven, that is, the world of light.
\n\nAt that time, there was not a single joyful thing in Jesus` entire living environment. Everywhere he went there was persecution, and everywhere he went false accusations blocked his way, but he did not grieve. Even when facing a desperate situation, he never despaired.
\n\nWe know the will for which he endured while watching your dispensation for the sake of a world of hope and for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven of the future.
\n\nEven though the sons and daughters who are gathered here are at a historical distance of 2,000 years, we must become sons and daughters who are able to heartistically communicate with the heart of Jesus of 2,000 years ago, and relate to you from a position of taking the heavenly responsibility of heaven.

Father!
\nWe are reflecting on the day of the historical anguish of Jesus, when he, who lived for over 30 years, faced the day of his grief-filled destiny, having the Will of the providence of salvation of the earth in his heart and having heaven in his heart, but without having found a single person who related to him as the Savior, without having found a single family that attended him as the Savior, and without having led a single people who followed him as the Savior.
\n\nJesus had to go the path of the cross at a time he did not want to, and he had to bring his mission to a conclusion when it was not yet time, so he couldn`t say everything he had to say; and without having been able to carry out the heroic decisions and determinations he had set in his heart, he left behind grief, and took it with him when he went; but where is the person who knows his heart?
\n\nOh Father! Today we have not known to the marrow of our bones that anguished tears for all of humankind were brimming in Jesus` eyes as he looked up to heaven, and the worn-out external form he had while facing death was representing all of humankind, and there was no one among the people of that time, either, who knew that the person going through such ghastly suffering was the son of God.
\n\nSince the people who should have known and attended Jesus opposed him instead and acted violently in order to drive him to the way of the cross, how pitiable was Jesus who had come embracing the Will?
\n\nIn spite of their being the people who should have communicated with the heart of heaven and communicated with the heart of Jesus, Jesus had to be concerned for them instead, and while looking at those people, who were in the realm of death, playing in the hands of the enemy, without knowing the sorrow of Jesus, who was being dragged away by the enemy, Jesus had to pray and say, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." We earnestly hope and pray, Father, that you will let us become able to seek and feel the heart of Jesus who had to do that.
\n\nWhen we have spoken of the cross, we have known it by name only. We did not know that the mount of Golgotha was hell for Jesus, and was the place of the execution of his death. But now when we think of the cross, please let us know that the tearing sorrow of the heart of grief of God which had accumulated over 4,000 years was so much greater than the pain of the tearing of Jesus` body. Please let us become people who are able to know that it was more sorrowful for Jesus to have wrung out his heart than it was to have his flesh ripped and his blood flow on the cross.
\n\nDo you have any true sons and daughters among the group gathered here today? Is there anyone who is hoping to receive the blessings of heaven but ignores the blood Jesus shed? Is there anyone who seeks to relate to the Will of heaven, but steps on the heart of Jesus?
\n\nPlease let us become a group that is able to weep endlessly over the death of Jesus and remember that one day of sorrow which cannot have its grief resolved even though we weep and weep, and weep again.
\n\nWe have prayed in the name of the Lord.

\nHow frustrated, grieved, sorrowful, and painful must have been the heart of Jesus Christ who, while looking at the Last Days of Israel, which you had worked hard for 4,000 years to lead, could not speak words of congratulations to that people and could not help but speak words of lamentation.
\n\nFather! We know that the frustration of heaven filled his entire being, the innermost heart of Jesus, as he watched the many people who were struggling on the verge of death, when they did not listen even though he advised them and when the ignorant crowds were not able to be enlightened even though he sought to enlighten them. And we know that the more that frustration filled him, the more his mind wanted to resent this earth. But there was no one on the earth who knew the heart of Christ who suppressed that and endured.
\n\nWe have come to know that it was historical grief that, while attending the holy majesty of Christ who worked so hard, like a brother and like a father, in order to pioneer his lonely course, and while becoming one mind with him, we did not weep together when Jesus Christ was weeping, or starve together when he was starving, and that we were not dressed shabbily together when he was dressed shabbily, or beaten together when he was beaten, or driven out together when he was driven out, who, by finding and entering the foundation of heart now, are able to hold and embrace the internal character of Christ, and who, by becoming heartistic friends able to communicate with his circumstances, are able to rush towards the mount of Calvary in Jesus` stead.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will allow us to experience and feel keenly that if we are sons and daughter like that, we are friends of Christ, and people who attend the son of heaven going beyond history. Jesus came to this earth and shed countless tears, but no one knew about that, and with a grieving heart, shedding bitter tears, he appealed to heaven, but there was no one who knew that, either.
\n\nFather, today we thank you for having trained us by driving the Unification believers into pitiful positions.
\n\nWe thank you for having united us in the midst of hunger. Father, please let us become sons and daughters who are concerned about the Will, even if we are dressed shabbily, and who are concerned about you, even if we are beaten.
\n\nWe know that this is your desire, Father, and it is your Will to establish people like that about whom you can boast before this people. Now since the time has come to fulfill the mission of finding and establishing people like that, please do not let us be cowardly while facing this mission, and please do not let us hesitate while facing this mission. Earnestly desiring that you will let us become sons and daughters who are able to leave results before you by giving all the love and sincerity we have, and who are able to be remembered in your heart.

At the same time that this morning is the first Sunday we greet in this new year of 1965, it is also the day on which we greet the 1,965th year since the incarnation of the Lord. Many people decided, according to what they thought, and have celebrated the birthday of the messiah, but they did not even know after the messiah came to this earth what kind of destined relationship and value were decided together with humankind, together with the world, and together with the universe, and remembering only his fame, they have celebrated the messiah`s birthday.
\n\nBut the small group of us which has gathered like this today cannot help but sympathize in our hearts with the situation of Jesus who had been sent 2,000 years ago through your mighty, sublime will and sacred administration, but who faced a miserable situation, and we cannot help but feel pain to depths of our bones that at that time the people of Israel did not fulfill their mission.
\n\nWe know that that person who was born as your precious son, was a person sent in order to resolve your sorrow over having lost Adam, who turned his back on the ideal of creation of heaven and earth.
\n\nAs for the messiah, Jesus, whom you sent in order to achieve the desire you had for a world of joy which you wanted to realize through him, the glory you wanted to receive through him, and the Will you wanted to realize through him, from the day he was born, he lived in a wretched environment.
\n\nMany people anticipated the messiah, but they did not know the one who really came as the messiah. When we think that the messiah alone had God`s heart in his heart, and his living situation was such that he had to live with the hope of God and without others knowing him, he appeared as a humble person, was nailed to the cross through pitiful circumstances, shed tears and blood, and died, we cannot help but apologize at this time for our ancestors having been unworthy, and we cannot help but apologize for Judaism which had the responsibility but did not fulfill its mission completely and for Judaism`s sin of having betrayed God.
\n\nPlease let this become a time when we once again deeply seek in our hearts and think and repent for the history of sin which made successive generations of our ancestors shed blood, and for all the sins of the many people who have betrayed God.
\n\nFather! We must consider your loneliness, and we must sympathize with the situation of Jesus who was falsely charged, and we must become people who are able to realize the lonely, miserable situation of his disciples who have gone a course of blood until now Please do not let us forget that today our entire purpose for commemorating the birth of the messiah is in order to comfort as individuals, to comfort as families, as peoples, as nations, and furthermore, to comfort as a world, Jesus who died with sorrow in his heart.
\n\nTwo thousand years of history have gone by. During that time, how many sorrowful situations have there been? We know that you have been sorrowful, Father; Jesus has been sorrowful; the Holy Spirit has been sorrowful; and the Christians have been sorrowful, too. And we know that the final day of the Last Days, that is to say, the Day of Judgment, which is to resolve that kind of sorrowful grief, is near.
\n\nThe believers in these Last Days, who are in the position of having to greet once again the messiah who comes in order to resolve your grief which has piled up over and over again, Father, must not just long for the messiah without having minds capable of being obedient to the messiah who is coming and without preparation like the people of Israel who longed for the messiah; therefore, we earnestly hope that you will let each one of us be aware of these kinds of things.
\n\nWe have prayed all these things in the holy name of the Lord.

\nTwo thousand years ago you chose the people of Israel and you sought to have them experience and feel your heart keenly through their minds and bodies, but we know well that that your Will has still not been accomplished.
\n\nWe know that there were many people who were unfaithful, but there were no people who had the life of heaven as they related to the Will of the providence. Jesus came to this earth and sought to reveal the life of heaven, but since there was no one who followed him, he died alone. But today we earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will guide us to become a group that is able to inherit the mission of Jesus and that is able to inherit the will of Jesus by becoming a lamp to all of humankind.
\n\nOh Father! Until now you have endured while watching the social environment of fallen faithlessness and now we thank you that out of concern for the world you have chosen us, and that you have allowed us the grace of being able to stand before heaven more constantly as the world becomes more evil. We cannot help but think about the position of Jesus Christ who could not help but be subjected to sorrow due to the faithlessness of Israel. We know that he spoke representing the sorrow of heaven, and his actions were due to his faith, and were centered on you, Father.
\n\nPlease guide us to attend you with our minds and bodies by connecting with your dream and by restoring through indemnity the sins of humankind now in the Last Days. On this earth there are many people who believe, but just as there were no people who truly followed you among the people of Israel, today Christianity, which must represent the new Israel, is not able to take responsibility for the entirety of the Will of the providence due to not knowing your Will. Oh Father, please let us be able to realize that Will, and by guiding us please allow us to be able to remain eternally after having been called by you.
\n\nWe know that when you chose us, it was not for ourselves alone that you chose us; you chose us for the people and for the world; therefore, please guide us according to your Will.
\n\nEven if we are beaten many times, torn apart, and persecuted, if it is the case that there could be one life such as you anticipate, we earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will guide us to become people who are able to endure as long as necessary and to offer you the victory.
\n\nFather: Please let this become a precious time in which we pledge that we will accomplish your Will by connecting our hearts with the heart of heaven now. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that, having allowed the Will of the providence, you will allow us to be able to go forward taking responsibility for your Will with love, and that you will allow us to be able to go forward for the sake of the way of the Will alone by experiencing and feeling keenly the heart of heaven.
\n\nEarnestly hoping that you will allow us to be able to live centered on your will alone by clinging to you whether we live or die, if it is your Will, and by our minds searching for your life, and our bodies searching for the path of your life, we have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Father!
\nWhen we reflect on the path that the Unification movement has walked, we realize that this movement is a movement that no one at all has loved; the nation opposed it, the established churches opposed it, the parents opposed it, and that position of having been opposed by each individual has been just like the position of Jesus who was driven to the way of the cross.
\n\nAs for the 2,000-year course after being driven out and dying on the cross, Jesus has sought individuals, has sought families, has sought tribes, has sought peoples, has sought nations, and has sought the world, but he has sought them on the spiritual level alone. We have come to think that it was the ardent wish of the hope you held to bequeath this spiritual standard and to connect it to a substantial level, and it is the result of the toil you went through for six thousand years.
\n\nThe path that the Unification Church has walked until today was in order to find once again individuals, families, tribes, and churches by inheriting the destined relationship with the grief-filled innermost heart of Jesus and not dying even though we have been driven out substantially by this people.
\n\nWhen we have ideas like this, as for this nation and this people, we have come to realize that they have come to an age where they are able to stand in an even higher position than Judaism by having the same standard among the religious bodies. The group that became one through the gospel of Jesus was in a stronger position than the group centered on Judaism which opposed Jesus. When we think that you have established us in just that kind of position now, we truly want to thank you.
\n\nWe must realize that there remains before us a lifelong mission in which it will not do unless we go beyond the church and go up to the level of the people, and we must clearly realize that no matter what kinds of difficulties we encounter, and no matter what kinds of sacrifices we have to make, it is only if we go beyond this path that there is a way for us to live and to settle down. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to be able to determine once again that we will invest all manner of devotion for this alone, whether we are asleep or awake.
\n\nWhen we think that a day of certain victory is coming in the not too distant future, we must give the love that Jesus could not give, and we must receive the love that Jesus could not receive.
\n\nWe are very grateful for the historical fact that your grief and the grief of Jesus will be resolved through us because this kind of thing is happening in the Unification movement, and please do not allow us to lose this precious opportunity which comes only once in a lifetime.

Father!
\nThe Jewish religious bodies and many priests were people who said that they were establishing the standard of heaven by demonstrating the internal destined relationship of heaven in their lives and attending heaven on their own.
\n\nBut we know the fact that in relation to Jesus Christ, who appeared as the center of life, as the crystallization of life, as the center of love, and as the crystallization of love, they ignored him so coldly, and among the Jewish religious bodies which were spiritually responsible for the nation of Israel, there was not a single person who was on Jesus` side. When we think that that was the result of the 4,000 years of suffering of our indignant Father, we cannot help but face you with tears, Father.
\n\nFather! There was not a single brother who stepped forth to block the history of sorrow and enmity, or cried out putting his life on the line by standing on the side of Jesus, who was filled with grief as he left on his final journey. And when we consider the fact that not even his mother said, "I\'ll go in his place," in relation to Jesus` path of death, we see that Jesus was truly to be pitied.
\n\nWhen we reflect on the fact that Jesus` end was so regrettable and tragic, we want to curse the nation of Israel and Judaism of the past with minds filled with enmity. But Jesus did not curse them; rather, for fear that the realm of Israel, which God had gathered together by working so hard for 4,000 years, would collapse, he had to ask for blessings for them even while he was on the way to death; therefore, we absolutely must come to know the indignant heart of Jesus who had to do that.
\n\nWe must earnestly feel that Jesus, who did not receive any sympathy even while on his way to death, was in the situation of a lonely orphan. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to realize clearly that it is we, it is the Unification movement alone, that remains in this very historical age as the group in the position of having to become the friend of Jesus who was like that, having to become the relative of Jesus who was like that, having to become the religious body of Jesus who was like that and beyond that, of having to become the sisters and the bothers of Jesus who was like that.
\n\nFather! Today, when Christmas comes, many people are praising the fact and spreading the news from person to person that Jesus was the person who was born with the mission of the messiah who had to save all people. But when we come to know the real situation, if we think that Jesus was a person who was born in such a lonely way in the midst of historical sorrow, we must become people who weep, and who are able to comfort and weep over the pitiable nature and feelings of the sorrowful inner heart of Jesus who was like that.
\n\nFather! From the day that we came to know the Will, we knew that it was our responsibility to have to resolve the sorrowful grief of Jesus, and because we knew that we would have to resolve your sorrowful grief, until today we have gone forward fighting and have built up this Unification movement today. When we think of the fact that you can teach and reveal your full, sorrowful story like this, and for the first time in the history of the world there have appeared a destined relationship and a foundation that can listen to it, since we must not forget that this place is really a place that is able to receive your hope, please do not allow us to forget that your heart is hoping to be linked here again.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Father of Love!
\nThank you for having come to us. Today you have come to us in joy, but we are afraid that as you leave tomorrow you won`t be able to promise a day to recite poems of joy when you leave. We have come to know that your complicated course, as you have been dealing with humankind, has been one where you met people in joy but where the days of departure were departures in sorrow.
\n\nPlease allow us to have more longing for you tomorrow than today, and please allow us to be able to long for you even more as we enter our old age than in our youth. In that way please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to go forward step by step to the profound and sublime world of the heart.
\n\nFurthermore, please allow us to comfort your heart of enmity, to resolve the grief of the enmity of Jesus, and to resolve the grief of the enmity of the historical ancestors, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that because of us, the final mission of today, the heavenly resolution of grief, will be accomplished and offered to you.
\n\nToday we have come to know that Jesus came with the heart of a pioneer. Why was his glory turned into pioneering? It was because John the Baptist betrayed him; it was because the religious bodies betrayed him; it was because the people betrayed him; and it was because all the people of the world betrayed him.
\n\nAs long as we know that this is the historical reality left behind in the Christian history of today, please allow internally determined hearts to soar up on the foundation of our minds, like the determined heart of Jesus who started from the preparation period, went through the period of accomplishment, and went up towards the standard of perfection.
\n\nJesus faced enemies on the level of the people and enemies on the level of the nation, but since today we have the responsibility to face enemies beyond the people, on the level of the world, and enemies on the level of the cosmos, that is to say, since we have a responsibility such that it will not do unless we cope with the mission of the final pioneer, please give us ability, Father. Earnestly hoping that you will allow us to become sons and daughters of victorious glory by enthusiastically walking to the end of the path of the world-level Golgotha and by carrying this responsibility by ourselves.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We hope that you will allow us to become children who can make you happy, Father, and who are able to follow your voice which is calling us and run out onto the field of battle, in order to realize the hope you desire, while looking up at heaven and at all the things of creation.
\n\nWe must know your lonely historical grief, and we must know the truth of how anxious and grievous your footsteps have been as you have sought this world. When we think that our bodies must be your footholds as you go, Father, and must be used as the materials to smooth out a level path, we come to know that even though we fall over, struggle, and shed blood because it is a path of thorns, the mission of having to pioneer this path is the true mission and the responsibility that we must fulfill.
\n\nPlease allow us to pave the way this people will go by offering our minds and bodies, and by this people`s being established, please let them be able to pave a straight way on which all people can go towards you, Father. We earnestly hope that you will allow this people to become able to receive this kind of grace of love.
\n\nFather! We have walked a path that others have not known and that others have not welcomed. There were many sad times and there were many lonely times. But because it was the path that you have been going, we welcomed it with tears and grateful hearts, and we know that we have called out to you millions of times with voices reflecting hearts filled with tears, and we know how precious is the fact that together with our voices which called out to you and together with our tears, you also shed tears.
\n\nPlease remember the names of the earnest and admirable Unification workers who did not mind going the way of hard work in order to go that path, because they knew it was that kind of path, and who struggled along the path of asceticism, and who went forth taking as their standard the world-level course of Golgotha in order to greet the day of joy when they could call out to you. Today is there anyone who is tired of being devoted to your Will? We earnestly hope that you will love them again by reaching out with your heart of mercy.
\n\nSince we must now walk again on the path of grief-filled restoration, please consider those footsteps as holy, and please remember how they look. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become your sons and daughters who are able to be placed by you personally in front of many people by having received your protection and authority, by having a hundred victories for every hundred battles wherever we go, and by establishing a foundation of glory before you, and who are able to have you praise us, saying, he is my son, and she is my daughter.
\n\nEarnestly hoping that only the glory of victory will remain before the Will which you are planning on the remaining path of restoration.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.

\nPlease look with mercy on your children who have gathered here today. All of your children here will have to go and find the nation of the original homeland. Who could have known that this path which leads to the nation of the original homeland was such a difficult path?
\n\nFather! Please allow us to step on this foundation of enmity, on this grief-filled world of lamentations, and by kicking it aside, please let us have an explosion of new minds which are able to fly like missiles to a new stage. Please allow us to have the explosive power and driving force of heart. Since we know that in order to do that, it will not do unless we have your love, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become people like that.
\n\nWe know that it doesn`t matter even if someone blocks and opposes this path. The way we must go is pressing, and because it is pressing we cannot rest even if we want to, and since we know that we are unification children who are facing the destiny we must go and that we must urge ourselves on, please smooth the way in front of us and please let us determine to fight at each peak on the path we are going. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will please not allow there to be anyone who falls down after having gone up.
\n\nPlease remember those who have endured and gone along suppressing their sorrowful breasts along the many courses of history, and please do not allow the light of apprehension, despair, or defeat to shine on their faces. Father, we have had that kind of past, but please allow us to be able to go forward in the midst of the hope of tomorrow with hearts that are bursting, overflowing with hope, and overflowing with joy.

\nWe thought that being your sons was only good, and we have lived forgetting the fact that to the extent that we are your sons, the cross is placed on our shoulders.
\n\nBut now we have come to understand, Father, that our being different from the people of the world is this kind of difference, and we are able to receive your love because of this aspect, and our being able to shoulder the burden of history is because of this, too.
\n\nToday, when we look at the world of Satan, we come to know the truth that in order to search for a second beginning, your love has been accompanying us deeply throughout the course of history and now in this age. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become your sons and daughters who are able to be grateful for this.

Please go together with us along this path we are going while being so busy that we have no time to eat even though we want to, and we have no time to sleep even though we want to.

Father!
\nHaving written Christian history over thousands of years, you have related to history on the solid foundation of your unchanging innermost heart. We know well that the historical story of your having carried out the providence until now is a story of your having shortened the complicated stages of the sinful elements along that course by having paid indemnity.
\n\nWe have come to fathom that it is the way of your Will that for thousands of years good people have been sacrificed in order to prepare the beginning about which you can say, "This is it," at a starting point that resulted from that shortened history. Along that way, many people shed blood, but we know that there was no person who shed blood while standing in the position you truly wanted. Because that was your grief, Father, in order to resolve that decisive starting point you sent Jesus, but we know that even Jesus died with the sorrow of not having been able to find that starting point centered on the earth and the spirit world.
\n\nThen the history of toil of our Father, who carried out the providence even by having extended history, went forward having fallen down to being a miserable path with the added burden of the cross. We know that then, in order to resolve that in the historical Last Days, once again you prepared this kind of awesome starting point by establishing the Unification Family. But we must know clearly that this starting point definitely is not realized from a reckless position. We must realize that it is accomplished only if we have unchanging content following certain sound, fundamental rules.
\n\nWhen we think about what you will request of us at this point, we come to think that it is not the widening of a foundation of external power; rather, it is the building up of one individual, one family, and one tribe which have been transformed by the Principle on a solid foundation. We must realize the truth that, that movement is more precious than anything else.
\n\nWhen we think of things like this, if we reflect once again on how important we have considered a view of life that is in accord with the Principle up until now, we cannot help but realize that we are people who have been disloyal to you, Father. When we think that until now we have gone forward from a position of each of us going our own ways, leaving the Principle as the Principle and our daily lives as our daily lives, please allow each one of us to admit once again that we have not been loyal or filial to you, our Father, who has worked so hard for each of us.
\n\nPlease pardon the sorrow of the past when we could not have sovereignty where we could become one with you from a position of the Principle and our daily lives having become one. And furthermore, please demolish our selves which are facing such a present situation. Then we earnestly hope and desire that you will once again let us realize that it will not do unless we become people who have principled characters, who are confident that you can dwell at a starting point, at the same time that we can represent you eternally.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the True Parents.
\nAmen.

Beloved Father!
\nWe have realized that you are seeking princes and princesses of victory who praise the glory of the victory of tomorrow while enthusiastically seeking the world of the springtime culture in their hearts, having the substance which is able to go through a destined relationship of all four seasons with our Father who is the eternal subject.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will let us become your children who are able to be aware of how holy our own selves appear who have been called to this holy fate. A person comes and passes away once. However precious life may be, we know that it cannot he compared to the bloom of youth.
\n\nOh Father, when we enter our prime of life, we have burdens to carry, and if we fight and cannot keep up, we know that our descendents, who are the fruit of that, will be miserable. Because of that, we know that only if we live vigorously during our prime of life, and while going through our old age are a family which has in its bosom descendents who are able to greet the new spring and see the new summer season, then later we will be able to overcome without difficulties the winter season which will come to us.
\n\nThe more we understand that three billion people of the world are standing on a line now that determines their final destiny in front of the abyss of hopelessness due to the fall, we come to know that the winter season can be overcome in the world of humankind only if there are princes and princesses of heaven here who are able to represent the spring of tomorrow and who are able to represent the summer of tomorrow. Judging from this we come to know the fact that God`s providence accomplishes its decisive beginning which is able to have victory over the realm of death by connecting the destined relationships to other destined relationships from that point.
\n\nOh Father` Please let us kick aside the grief of our ancestors who died leaving behind sorrow, and please let us kick aside the stronghold of the enemy which bore the fruit of enmity with humankind, and please let us be able to have the hope of tomorrow in our breasts.
\n\nHaving passed through springtime and summertime, we are the substantial fruits of the autumn season; therefore, we must become people who are not unworthy of inheriting the world of hope of the future. Then we must become sons and daughters who appear as heavenly princes and princesses who do not fear the approaching winter season and who are able to survive as the frame of reference of your victory. Earnestly hoping that you will let this insignificant group of people gathered here become those kinds of sons and daughters.

\nWe long for your voice which gave directions to us. Please let that touching voice which told us to head towards the greatest goodness once again move our minds at this time.
\n\nWe long for the earnest appeal of our broken-hearted father who advised us to go the way of historical misfortune by going over the path of persecution, the path of suffering, the path of difficulties, and the mount of Golgotha, which the Lord left behind. Father: Please have mercy on us since we are bowing down our heads before the awesome grace of your having told us to resemble the internal character of our extraordinarily sublime Lord, after having gathered us together, your children who have grown up as we wished, have lived as we wished, and are as we wish.
\n\nWe offer our thanks to you, our Father, who has called and gathered us, and has given the immeasurable grace of the blessing to us, your children, who are filled with sin, and who, even though we analyze our original natures or characters, have nothing to offer to you. Please let us experience and feel keenly and verify the broken-hearted situation and heart of our Father who earnestly asks only for faith and heart alone.
\n\nFather! We do not want to listen to the words of a person. We have already heard many words and seen many people. We have related to many people, and we have visited places that were inspiring, but they have all passed by without having formed relationships with us. The inspiration passed by as inspiration; the people passed by as people; and we who are left are like historical orphans who are all alone. Because of that, we are hoping that a new spring breeze will come. How much you must be longing to be able to allow grace like that, Father! Please let us become people who gather before your holy majesty with thirsting and eager minds and hearts which report truthfully. Father, we earnestly hope for and desire this.
\n\nWhat shall we say? Before speaking, please let us experience and feel keenly a deep inspiration which moves our minds without our even knowing it, and please let us be able to weep aloud and shed tears, and have our minds become overcome with grief without our knowing it. We know that such a state of mind does not occur unless heaven causes it, and we know that one experience is more valuable than millions of words.
\n\nSince we unworthy people have come before you, Father, please let us go back to having the minds of children. The people who say they have learned and know, how much do they really know, and those who say themselves that they have something to be proud of, how much do they have which they can put forward in heaven? We know that they have nothing.
\n\nWe know that more than excuses, the truth, and more than the truth, experiences of the heart are what will he collected after we die, and they are what will remain. Therefore, please personally manifest yourself to us, your children, who must be the central figures of history.

Therefore, Father, please allow our minds and bodies to become one centered on your Will. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will completely remove the footholds through which Satan can work in our minds and bodies, by breaking down the distance between your heart and our hearts.

Since these are minds and bodies which cannot help but kneel down before you, and are minds and bodies that have been stained by sin, and are inadequate minds and bodies which are longing to be filled by your overflowing grace, Father, please, take hold of all of our minds and bodies now.

Now please allow us to be able to kneel down in front of your majesty and return glory to you by having the standard of hope for which you have longed for six thousand years, and we earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will allow this to become a time when we can reveal your internal character to you, so that you will be able to rest.
\n\nWe know the fact that all the ideologies, doctrines, and the rights that people have, all these things will disappear.
