Father!
\nWe do not know the original heart of our Father who created humankind, and we know that we have not been able to feel our Father\'s love which can cast out sorrow.
\n\nNow even if we have to sacrifice everything we have, we must find your love, and we must recover the original destined relationship between you and us. Father! Please allow us to be able to open our minds now and to find out on our own what your heart is and what your love is. And please open our ears and let us be able to hear your voice. Please allow our eyes to see and be able to look up to our Father who is seeking sons and daughters who can receive the grace which heaven is allowing.
\n\nThen, as those who can see and as those who can hear, please allow us to sense the touch of our Father who has worked so hard for us, and please allow us to experience that heart of endurance. Since we know a little of the heart of our Father who has gone forth enduring and struggling, please take complete dominion over our minds and bodies as your own, Father.
\n\nIf there are sons and daughters who are ignorant and caught in the realm of death, Father, please directly extend your touch of grace and act to create everything. And we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow this to become a time when we are able to be in harmony with your mind, and can respond to the original appeal of your heart.
\n\nWe have realized that you have a will, Father, for which you have given your entire heart and mind, and we have realized that the course of history is the course determined by heaven which you have walked. And we know that it has been realized only through the people who have sought a value system that can relate to heaven and who are able to communicate with heaven.
\n\nIf we have the mission of rooting out the source of all the sins of the past, and all the sins of the present, and all the sins of the future, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will not allow us to be attracted by sin and feel the qualms of conscience, and that you will allow direct acts of your love to appear which are able to inspire our minds to want to thank you in the midst of your love.
\n\nWe know that the time has come when we must be familiar with the truth of heavenly morality, and the time has come when we must be familiar with the character of heavenly morality, and the time has come when we must be familiar with your love, Father.
\n\nFather! We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow the revealing of the truth which is able to introduce your love to all humankind, and that today in these last days you will allow a person of character who is able to testify to your love to appear before all people.
\n\nPlease allow us the preparation and foundation to enable our minds to follow that truth, and we earnestly hope and desire that you will act to bring about quickly in history the day when everything can be revealed in front of your Will.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We know the fact that the concept of creation is not to seek only a specially determined individual; it is to seek all humankind. Oh Father who has toiled seeking all the people on earth! When we think that the providential will to seek and establish an entire universe within the concept of goodness still remains to be done, we earnestly hope that you will allow us to be able to be of at least a little help to you and even if we were to die millions of times, that we would become fertilizer contributing towards realizing your Will.
\n\nPlease allow us to realize the fact that your sorrow did not occur because of all the things you created on this earth; rather it occurred because there has been no human individual who has been able to accomplish your concept of creation in place of you. Please allow us to be able to fight for the Will, offering our minds and our entire devotion, and please allow us to be able to understand that the creator who created all things is you, and the one who has worked endlessly for us is also you.
\n\nPlease allow us to understand that a person who does not know your heart is a person who does not know your life, and a person who has not experienced your heart is a person who does not know your situation. We earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will allow us to realize that at this moment, too, as you watch us you are filled with anguish since we are not able to attend your heart.
\n\nBy allowing our minds to become completely one with your Will, please lead us to live as your friends, and please guide us to be able to become people who can be directed by you and, who can live that way. We have come to understand that Jesus himself embraced your will like that and he was the person who appeared for the sake of the Jewish people.
\n\nPlease allow us to realize that it is heartbreaking for you not to be able to find substantial human beings in whom you are able to dwell even though human beings remain just as you created them and all things remain just as you created them. Beloved Father' Now please dwell within us, and please sanctify our minds and bodies so that we may become such people. And earnestly hoping and desiring that: you will lead us to become the heralds of the new age, accomplishing your concept of creation together with you and rejoicing together with you.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Father!
\nWe know that a person who does not desire to bow humbly while attending you will not be able to form a relationship with you in the eternal kingdom.
\n\nNow as we open our hearts and go out seeking, we are seeking the day we have longed for when our bodies are able to follow the subjective commands of our minds and we feel your heart at the center of our minds. Therefore, please allow us to become people who are able to bow our heads of our own accord, feeling that behind the scenes you have gone through a historical course of misfortune and toil for the sake of finding each one of us, and today please let us hear your voice flowing out of our minds and be able to find our bodies which had been lost.
\n\nAnd please allow us to become people who are able on our own to feel through our minds and bodies, minds that are in awe of you. We thought that you always came to us only as the father of glory, but you came to us as the lord of sorrow, and as the lord of suffering, and you came to us as an expression of misfortune. Because we did not know that you were like this, we have wanted to give you responsibility for our sorrow, and have wanted to give you responsibility for our difficulties, and have wanted to give you responsibility for our misfortunes. Please bear with us.
\n\nYou have walked this kind of course of history, and have come to us lamenting and keeping your sorrow under control. Please let us realize that we are a fallen tribe who cannot even call you "Father." Please do not allow there to be any sons or daughters who do not know your course of sorrow as we seek to relieve you of your toil of millions of years.

Oh Father!
\nOur grief-filled history has wound itself around us and is moving us along. We know that we who are facing this living environment filled with grief have the awesome mission of dealing with the grief-filled history and of relieving the heart of heaven which is filled with grief.
\n\nWe who are shouldering this kind of mission must embrace the heart of heaven and earth, and even if we die ten million times feeling your suffering and experiencing your sorrow, we must become sons and daughters who seek to die in a position that is able to console our Father.
\n\nAt the time Jesus came to the earth, many religious bodies and believers were longing for the messiah, but they thought the messiah would come with the ideal appearance that they were hoping for. But the messiah who came was not a messiah of joy; he was a messiah of the encapsulated sorrow of humankind and was a messiah of suffering corresponding to the suffering of human history. We know that at that time there was not a single person who thought that the messiah who came as the representative of the Kingdom of Heaven would appear in that way.
\n\nWe know that history occurs as it has been shown. We are learning the principle that things are restored by indemnity, that realities which appeared in history are repeated exactly in the last days. We know that it is the responsibility of the saints of the last days to return joy of a horizontal nature to you, Father, having dealt with horizontally and developed horizontally centered on our own selves the sorrowful emotions of the Garden of Eden, the sorrowful emotions of the course of history, and the sorrowful emotions of the vertical flow of history.
\n\nOh Father! Now we want to offer our loyalty for the sake of the world. We want to establish the welfare of heaven for the sake of all humankind. Please let us realize that in order to do that, we must become leading figures who inherit the suffering and sorrow which permeate heaven.
\n\nPlease let us understand that only those who absorb all suffering and sorrow can appear as heirs of heavenly joy, and please let us endure whether there is sorrow or suffering, and we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become historical sacrifices who go forth saying, "I will die for the sake of the life of the whole."
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to seek and experience through our minds and bodies your external form, your situation, and your heart, Father, as you made your way through the lonely course of restoration in order to find the true children you lost.
\n\nYou were not able to love Adam and Eve with a mind of love which penetrated your heart. Please let us become your sons and daughters who are able to experience your heart, oh Father, as you went forth starving for love for the long period of six thousand years. And please allow us to become earnest children who embrace and comfort your lonely heart.
\n\nNow please allow us to be able to offer our minds and bodies as yours, Father. We earnestly hope that you will lead us to become sacrifices of victory who are able to be proud of belonging to our eternal father and who do not think of our minds and bodies as our own. And we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become your descendents who are able to relieve you heart which has not been able to embrace and love with a true heart of love for six thousand years.
\n\nThere are many people living on the earth, but we know that there are no sons or daughters whom you can embrace and love, saying, "These are my sons and daughters," and explaining to Satan that they are your sons and daughters.
\n\nEven when 2,000 years ago Jesus walked the course of the battle to save all the people on the earth, we know that you were not able to directly embrace and love him.
\n\nWe know the fact that no one can take away your beloved child. We know that Jesus moved your heart deeply, but he was not able to receive your love. We also know your situation of not having been able to love. Therefore, please establish the day of glory and establish sons and daughters of heaven and release your full heart, and while embracing and loving please express all of your heart. Please allow us to realize that it is your hope for those kinds of sons and daughters of heaven to appear on this earth.
\n\nToday we have nothing, and even if we lost everything, we want to become sons and daughters who are embraced in the bosom of your love and are able to receive your eternal love.
\n\nBeloved Father! Please bless us. Please stretch out your mighty hand and sanctify us. Please cast out all elements of evil, and we earnestly hope that you will allow our minds and bodies to become completely yours, Father.

When deep in our hearts we try to reflect once again on this thing called the will of the providence which we did not know, we realize only too well the fact that humankind has not been able to communicate with your innermost thoughts even though a long history of six thousand years has passed since our ancestors fell. Furthermore, we have realized that your situation is difficult and miserable, and we have realized that today your hope is remaining in front of the earth, humankind and heaven.
\n\nToday as we consider whether we possess the fidelity of sons and daughters who can receive praise in front of our sacred Father, and while standing in the garden of your heart, and standing in your realm of hope can say, "Father! Please be comforted for I am here." We cannot help but admit that we are far distant from that standard.
\n\nWhen Jesus Christ, who came as the incarnation of your hope and who could represent your heart, appears on the earth again, a person who is groping for and searching for the heart of heavenly morality will have to communicate with that heart of Jesus. And as for the chosen nation of Israel, which wandered in order to communicate with the heart of heavenly morality, we know that their situation and Jesus situation should have become one.
\n\nThe people of Israel should have known that the hope of our Father who sent Jesus was a hope for all people. But due to not recognizing Jesus who was the incarnation of hope, this anguish has continued down until us today, and we furthermore feel the historical sorrow of its having been passed down.
\n\nWhere has the Jewish religion gone which you sought and established over a four thousand year period, and where have the people of Israel gone? The temple you raised up in Jerusalem was prepared for the sake of Jesus, but it was not able to form a relationship with Jesus, and the Jewish religion was not able to form a relationship with Jesus either.
\n\nEven the prepared people, from their position of not forming any relation whatsoever with Jesus, stood in a position of driving him out. But we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will let us become people who know the situation of Jesus, who had no choice but to stand alone in a solitary position like that and pray for the sake of the people who cast him out.
\n\nNow facing you, Father, what do we want to shout out? And what do we want to find in relation to you, and what do we want to ask for? Please let us have hearts that represent your heart just as Jesus did, and which our ancestors were not able to do.
\n\nWe know that it will not do unless we become beings who, with Jesus' situation and hope, have hearts that are the same as yours in the last days and who have the responsibility to indemnify all the historical debts in relation to you up until now.
\n\nNow we know that the path of the cross remains ahead of our footsteps. The time has come when we cannot help but fight with the evil world with eyes brimming with tears, and we know that you have called us because the time has come for us to communicate with your heart, in order to do that, please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to offer ourselves as sacrifices of victory, who are able to realize your hope for you, by making your heart and mind our heart and mind, your situation our situation, your hope our hope, your enemy our enemy and your battle our battle.

We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow our minds and bodies to feel that you have remained in endless sorrow and endless suffering and that you have shed tears without our knowing it.
\n\nPlease allow us to experience through our minds and bodies the entirety of your sorrowful heart, and please let: us realize at this time that your sorrow due to the fall of Adam and Eve was great. Please let us realize that it also caused unspeakable suffering, loneliness and sorrow for you that Jesus Christ, who came to the earth and took responsibility for the will of the providence of restoration, was not able to complete his entire mission and died on the cross.
\n\nAs we think about your having gone through the sorrowful course of history about which you could not help but feel greatly indignant because our ancestors betrayed you, we ask you to please not allow us to stand in a pitiful position which would add more to your sorrow through our lives today. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become people who are able to cope with the sorrow of Adam and Eve and to cope with the sorrow of Jesus Christ.
\n\nNow please do not let our minds and bodies remain as our own simple minds and bodies alone. Please allow our minds to represent your mind, Father, and our bodies to represent your external form.

\nEach time something sorrowful happened on the earth, heaven was sorrowful, too, our ancestors were sorrowful, too, all the things of creation were sorrowful, too, and today we are sorrowful, too. Even though humankind looked forward to the day of liberation, which would eliminate this sorrow, humankind did not know the way to go, and even while looking for that something, humankind could not realize what it was and wandered around and groped along. But we, who have realized the fact that you have gone through this long period of time of six thousand years, have hearts that want to embrace you and weep endlessly if you appear now.
\n\nNow we who know all these things and have gone forth searching for our original parents, hope that through our minds and bodies the day will come quickly when instead of tears of sorrow we shed tears of joy, and we will eliminate sorrow and only joy will remain.
\n\nNow we have realized where we should go; we have also realized where we belong, and we have realized the value of the original children.
\n\nFather! Now we are running up the slope of restoration dragging our wounded legs, and we are heading towards the summit which Adam and Eve hoped for. Now we earnestly hope and desire that you will let your inspiration appear in our minds and bodies, adding to our final power to let us be able to go over this line.
\n\nIf there is anything that you want to say to us, we know the fact that you are not happy but rather endlessly sorrowful, that you have had endless difficulties, and that you have had endless suffering.

\nLike orphans going back and forth, we do not know our purpose or our direction, and without even knowing what kind of environment we are facing, we are being knocked over according to the flow of history; and without being able to establish the center of our lives, we have been pushed and pushed along. We realize that we have gone forth in such a pitiful manner until today.
\n\nOn the other hand, we did not know the fact that you held us even though we were like this; and when we were sad, you were sad together with as. And we did not know the fact that you were the Lord who did not distinguish between night and day and worked so hard in order to seek us out when we were caught and groaning in the realm of death. Please allow us to realize that a heart of joy which is able to know and feel this kind of fact is more precious than communicating with heaven and earth.

Now we earnestly hope and desire, father, that you will allow this time to become one in which we place before you all the difficulties, sorrows, and worries that permeate our innermost thoughts, and we are able to change them and adopt yours.
\n\nWe know the fact that our Heavenly Father exists who exerts himself for us and that an even greater heaven exists which is concerned about our lives. Please allow us to feel awe as we relate to you, our father, through our minds and bodies. Please reveal to us the heart of our father who has taken the position of being injured first before we were injured, and who when our bodies were exhausted and collapsing who has held us, embraced us comforted us and once again urged us on the way we were to go.
\n\nPlease let us admit that until today we have lived by words alone. From now on please allow us to be able to know you and to be able to become one in heart with you as sons and daughters who are able to understand your situation. And from a position so firm that even if we wanted to fall away we would not be able to, and even if we wanted to be divided we could not, and there could be no being whatsoever who could separate us from you, please let us feel heaven's sorrow as our sorrow, heaven's joy as our joy, heaven's work as our work, and heaven's responsibility as our responsibility.
\n\nToday we know that, standing in an eternally unchanging position, we have taken a position as people responsible for having to fight with myriads of satans. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to experience the sternness of the fact that it will not do unless we stand in the position of sacrifices in order to save the whole.
\n\nFather! Please eliminate all the elements of our minds that are not proper, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to be able to make the firm determinations and decisions that will allow us to become one with you and to harmonize with your internal character and your mentality.

We know that Jesus and God had no respite from sorrow as they related to humankind. When we reflect on Jesus life 2,000 years ago, we know that he shed tears which others knew nothing about; he lived an outstanding life which others knew nothing about; and he wept bitterly while going a course of persecution others knew nothing about.
\n\nJesus trod this kind of path, and the many saints who followed behind him were not concerned about walking a path of blood; we know the fact that they struggled forward, not being concerned even about the path of death.
\n\nThe path to the palace of heaven is the path of the cross. Therefore, please allow us to understand that each one must go to the top of Golgotha carrying his cross on his back, and each must experience persecution, even going to the point of shedding blood on the cross. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to understand that heaven is looking for people who forget about themselves, who forget about their own sorrows, who forget about their own pain, and who are giving their all today and tomorrow to go the path of Golgotha.
\n\nOh Father! Please allow us to understand the sorrow of Jesus who has laid bare his sorrowful heart today in this age. There is no need to know Jesus just as the historical Jesus; the time has come when we must know the modern Jesus within our own circumstances. Therefore, please let us become a movement crying out only to heaven, filled only with hearts that will offer our minds and bodies in front of that noble, majestic heart and in front of that love, whether we live or die.
\n\nWe know that this group is made up of people who have been chased on this earth, people who have been rejected by the religious bodies. We hope and desire that you will allow your sons and daughters who have gathered here to become a movement that is able defend that kind of position to the death.
\n\nThe mind of heaven appeared through the mind of one person and it had prepared a foundation of heart to unite 4,000 years of history, but because humankind destroyed and betrayed that, today humankind is in a wretched state. Father, please change the minds of the many people on this earth who do not know that their sorrow is your sorrow.
\n\nPlease allow us to become a solitary movement that knows how to weep and build an altar for their sake. We know that Jacob also built an altar in the wilderness, as did Moses and Elijah as well.
\n\nWe know the fact that among our ancestors who took responsibility for the will of heaven, there was no one who did not tread that kind of course.

Therefore please allow us to become people who are able to cope with our original natures and who are in awe over the grace you have given. We earnestly hope and desire that we will be able to attend you, Father.
\n\nFrom the time that we knew about the path that you were calling us to go, we knew that you were together with us along this way of tears, and we knew that you were together with us on the way of the cross, the way of suffering, the way of sorrow, and even on the way when we were bound in chains. And we know about the path of thorns you will tread in the course of history as you work behind your beloved sons and daughters.

\n\nFather! You know the direction that we will go, and you also know the path we will choose to walk. Our minds do not begin from within ourselves, and our being placed in advisory positions is not for our own selves. Then, if it is for others and for you, Father, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will take dominion over our hearts and not let them change to the very end.

Even if we feel the sorrow of our father who has carried out the providence, please do not allow us to become sons and daughters who cannot make it through this difficult period. We earnestly hope and desire that you will let us become sons and daughters who cast aside our selves, and are concerned for you, and who know how to comfort your heart and understand your situation.
\n\nAt this time in our minds, we are not asking for anything that is not of you. Now we must walk beyond today's suffering and look towards the garden of promise, and we must long for the Kingdom of Heaven of eternal blessings. We know that the blessings of God which will appear are a position of inexpressibly great glory. Therefore, today please allow us to become a movement of people whose hearts do not change in relation to you and who endure and remain to the end. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to fight to the end and stand before you, Father.

Since we are here to represent your will, please receive us!"'
\n\nWe know that it is your hope that those kinds of historical victors will appear - sons and daughters who will be able to comfort your sorrowful mind, and fight with the enemy and be victorious.
\n\nNow we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to call you our father from that kind of position, and who are able to comfort you.
\n\nSince we know that this is our hope, and it is your hope as well, please encourage us and lead us to that position. We will cling to your hand as you lead us, and we earnestly hope that you will let us become sons and daughters who have earnest minds which are willing to go on any kind of path of adversity.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We long for the day when we can live together with you. Please let us become sons and daughters who long for you, and run towards you, and who can bring all the things of creation into harmony by offering greetings of joy and gratitude to you, having arrived at the day of glory when we can live together with you.
\n\nSince our minds and bodies were created resembling the external form of our father, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who resemble you completely.
\n\nOh Father! Humankind does not know that your sorrowful mind has permeated the earth, and does not know that the footprints of human history are soaked with the lonely tears of heaven. We have not known that the endless lamentations of heaven are encircling our minds and bodies. Now we cannot help but admit that we are the descendents of rebellious humankind and that we cannot establish our dignity before heaven or be trusted by heaven.
\n\nFather! There is no one on earth who can stop your tears, and there is no one to hold and comfort you in your sorrow, and there is no one to guard the path you are going.
\n\nTherefore, if there is grief on this earth, that grief is heaven\'s grief which has permeated the earth; if there is sorrow, that sorrow is heaven\'s sorrow which has permeated the earth, and if there is enmity, that enmity is heaven\'s enmity which has permeated the earth.
\n\nTherefore, humankind who are living on this earth are facing a destiny of not being able to help but be sacrifices of sorrow whether they want to be or not, and are facing a destiny of not being able to help but overcome their grief-filled selves whether they want to do it or not.
\n\nIn the midst of despair, the time has come to cry out to heaven with all that remains of our voices, saying, "Father! Please help us!" And the Last Days are arriving when we must call out, "Oh Father! Please find humankind with your heart of love." But in this kind of age, is there anyone who is clinging to and anguishing over your heart, and is there anyone who is clinging to and weeping over your mind? If there is such a person, that person could be called your true son or daughter, and could be called your substantial reciprocal object partner.
\n\nOh Father, who has empowered our minds! We long for the stimulation of our minds which will let us feel your sad and indignant heart, and since we want to be close to the wellspring of your heart, please grant us the grace of being able to do that. Then if we are transformed by that heart, we know that at that point we will not be able to help but reveal our unworthiness, and we will not be able to help but repent taking on ourselves the sinful guilt of humankind.
\n\nFather! We, who are unworthy and inadequate, we, who have not been able to become solid rocks, are ashamed before you, our father who has established us and worried about us. It will not do unless we become saints who have a foundation where you can manifest yourself in glory through our having comforted your heart of sorrow and enmity. Therefore, please take dominion over us through your strength and power. If there are people who appear to have been twisted by sin, please touch them with your love, and take dominion over them again, and mold them into another form.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Father!
\nEven if we say that in the course of history humankind has struggled to find you, until now there have been no people on earth who have lived attending you.
\n\nIs there any corner on earth that is yours? Is there a single family that is yours? Is there a single people, a single nation that is yours? We are daring to ponder the heart of our father who has not been able to find or establish a single thing on the earth as his own. If you have sorrow, we know it would be that you who are the lord of the earth are not able to stand in the position of the lord, and you who must take responsibility for this earth have not been able to take that responsibility.
\n\nYou are in the position of having to take responsibility for all the people on the earth, but you have carried out a providence which could not take that responsibility. In spite of it being your position to command us directly, and take dominion directly through our hearts, you have not been able to be in such a position.
\n\nAnd in spite of the fact that you should have dominion over everything we have through our daily lives, you are not able to take dominion over our internal lives and circumstances. And in spite of the fact that you should be able to praise us as fruits of goodness, you have not been able to have that kind of day, or age or even one person. We did not know that you were in such a lonely position.
\n\nNow even if we would suffer the grief of losing everything that is on the earth, please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to communicate with your lonely heart. And please let us feel your situation and its complications from the position of real children, and please let us shed tears when you shed tears. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become your sons and daughters who know how to go through difficulties together with you as you go through them.
\n\nFather! We have realized that our minds are unworthy; we have realized that our bodies are base; and we have realized that our ambitions are moving together with Satan.
\n\nWe, who have these kinds of internal elements, are miserable people who cannot wait for the lord who is coming, representing heaven, in a period, in an age, at a time that you permit. Therefore, please let us know how to lament over our pitiful selves, and please let us know how to lament over our pitiful families, our pitiful society, pitiful humankind, and pitiful heaven and earth.
\n\nSince the time has come when we must be redeemed before heaven and earth through our sorrowful hearts, oh Father, please open the doors of our minds.
\n\nFather, our hearts are in a position of not knowing how to and not being able to relate to your heart. Therefore, we earnestly hope and desire that you will remold our minds and bodies which are like this into beings that are able to be transformed by your heart and your external form.
\n\nPlease cast out any of the earthly concepts or ideologies we have insisted on until now which heaven cannot approve of. Please raise up the level of our original senses so that all those things can be transformed as yours alone, and please raise up the level of our consciences.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will please connect our hearts, let us be able to communicate with your heart, and let us communicate with heavenly circumstances.
\n\nPlease send billions and trillions of the saints in heaven, and sanctify the area around us, and awakening each of our hearts, please remold us through your powerful touch.
\n\nThen, together with the words of re-creation, please allow us to be able to receive characters of re-creation and we, who are beings of death, will be transformed into beings of life.
\n\nPlease let us greet the time of joy when we call you "Father" in glory, rejoicing and joy.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We know that the greatest sorrows of humankind are: not having been able to form a relationship with your love, having lost our original consciences which could communicate with your heart, and not being able to harmonize our minds and bodies which would enable us to harmonize our consciences and your heart.
\n\nBecause of the Fall, our sense of being able to communicate with your heart left us, and our mind which could love all things through experiencing your heart was no longer with us. Therefore, Father, please guide us to be able to recover that heart. Please let our mind and body become one, and everything that is ours become yours. We earnestly hope and desire that you will work, Father, so that we will be able to place everything we have before you and, as people you can be proud of, we can open wide our arms of love with broad generous hearts which are able to embrace all of creation.
\n\nMy father: We know that we urgently need the word that will enable us to communicate with that kind of heart. What we have lost is the word, and next the substantiation of that word, and next the heart. Therefore, Father, through the word please raise up in us the original heart which was lost.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become people whose minds bow our heads to the original word, and whose bodies are able to lend their ears to the original word and who receive the grace of being able to be embraced in your bosom of glom.
\n\nBecause you are the one who started this work, we know that you are also the one who will accomplish it. And since it began through goodness, we know that it will be concluded through goodness. You have said that you are the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, and the beginning and the end. But because humankind lost the original heart in the beginning, when arriving at the end also, we cannot communicate with the heavenly heart. Now in the Last Days we should be clinging to the original heart and connecting to that heart. We earnestly hope and desire that you will bear with us who are languishing in the pits of the enmity of the fall.
\n\nPlease let us realize that our minds are not ours; they are yours, and please let us realize that our bodies are not ours; they are yours. We earnestly hope that you will allow us to be able to experience really and substantially the fact that our hearts and senses, none of these things belong to us; they belong to you and move through you.

\nAmen.

Father!
\nPlease allow us to experience heaven through our hearts. Please allow us to be able to experience the heart of our father which we cannot help but feel even if we don\'t want to. Father, please give us hearts that cannot help but repent before you even if we don\'t want to.
\n\nWe know that in places where people gather together with other people, things are solved and then become complicated again, but in places where people gather centered on heaven, the things that have formed knots in people\'s minds are solved. Now please raise up minds that are touched and that are able to long for the new day and reflect on ourselves and repent for the past through acts of inspiration, acts of repentance, and acts of indemnity which can solve fundamentally everything that has become tangled due to the tribes of evil. And we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow acts of re-creation to arise which will let us be able to repent for our selves having clung to that mind.
\n\nToday we are not longing for happiness of the body alone, and we do not want to live intoxicated by our minds alone. We desire only the garden where we can give our hearts the greatest value and live forever. We earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will please allow us to be able to form destined relationships which can exist deep in our hearts and that in our daily lives as well, the conditions for a heartistic destined relationship can explode out from each one\'s heart.
\n\nFather! On this holy day please pour down the grace of your blessings on all people. Representing the will and embracing your heart, appealing to heaven and raising up hidden altars, your sons and daughters who are praying know many things. Therefore, please bless them as well.
\n\nThis movement, which is embracing the lonely heart of heaven, and suffering with it, and even the many spirits of spirit world, who are awaiting the day of indemnified liberation, have a relationship with us. Therefore, Father, please allow their work also to have a good result through us. Please guide our inadequate selves who have not able to fulfill the level of heart that the Triune God who surrounds us is watching and longing for. Please establish us as beings of joy who are worthy of calling you "Father." If we have not yet received that kind of grace, we earnestly hope and desire that you will lead us at this time to become sons and daughters who, like gentle, humble children, attract your heart of mercy and compassion.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Father!
\nWe went forth thinking that the path you were calling us on was not difficult, but we have realized that it is difficult, and we thought it was a path of joy, but now as we go along it, we realize that it has peak after peak of tears.
\n\nFather! If we are sorrowful, we want to be sorrowful holding on to you. We have realized that it is easy to be disappointed after holding on to people and feeling sorrowful, and we have realized that to go ahead and believe people is to be hurt. It is you who have not changed, Father. How joyful a time it must have been for Jesus to go to the mountain in order to hold you and weep!
\n\nWe want to become true son and daughters who know how to weep for our father, people who know how to hold on to you and weep, and who know the heart of our father who has first pioneered this path and raised up Jesus in front of humankind because the road of life is lonesome and lonely.
\n\nIf we have realized that before we felt any anguish, heaven has suffered everything unjustly, and been persecuted cruelly, and been beaten cruelly, then how can we excuse ourselves before heaven? Since we have realized that before heaven we have no condition to be sad centered on our own selves, please have mercy on your sons and daughters here who have been placed in that situation.
\n\nFather! We know that before we wept you wept first, and before we were struck, you were struck first. And we know that before anything happened to us, it happened to you first. And we know that before we were in pain you were in pain first, and we know that before we fell down, you fell down first.
\n\nKnowing that, though we silently head towards heaven again and again, discovering how inadequate we are, we bow our heads before heaven, and we wonder how much you must have longed for sons and daughters who can call you "Father." Please allow those kinds of feelings to move in our hearts, and when relating to this nation, when relating to the world, when relating to heaven, please let those kinds of feelings move us.
\n\nOnly when we are moved by those kinds of feelings can we say we have confident faith from the individual up to the world-level ideological realm. And in order to establish our own ideology, we know that we must be in the position of heaven with the greatest heart. Therefore, we earnestly ask you to please raise up our minds to be able to go forth and pioneer a path for this kind of environment.
\n\nWe earnestly ask and desire that you will allow us to become children who are able to critique our forlorn selves as we go along the road humankind must go, and live intoxicated by you, and bow our heads and raise up your glory, Father, assessing highly our having formed a relationship between ourselves and heaven.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Father!
\nToday please allow all of our thoughts to move, our minds to move, and our bodies to move in the garden of your heart. We have realized that your heart is a heart of infinite love. And we have realized that your heart is an infinitely sorrowful heart and a heart that has been infinitely wounded.
\n\nOh Father, you have been exceedingly sorrowful; you have worked exceedingly hard, and even now your mind still feels exceedingly anxious! Please let us realize that you are the Creator, and you are the Lord of all things. Please let the extreme sorrow that you experience penetrate into our breasts, and please let your extraordinary anger and indignation flow into our breasts.
\n\nPlease let us become people who have experienced this, who are so submerged in sorrow that we cannot control our bodies and don\'t know where to go. And please let us become sons and daughters who weep, not knowing whether this is heaven or earth, unable to control our minds. We know that the altars of sorrow which continued for 6,000 years or more are due to the mistakes of our ancestors, but we are afraid that we might leave that sorrow to our descendents by once again not fulfilling our responsibility today.
\n\nToday, we have realized that we are responsible for blocking the history of misfortune in our present generation, and for saving the situation of the heart of heaven and changing it to a new heart of joy. Therefore, please allow us to share your heart.
\n\nThere are many people who look like people. But if we ask what is lacking on this earth and thereby makes heaven so sorrowful, we know that it is your having no sons or daughters who can communicate with your heart or who long for your love. Since we have realized that heaven is looking for such sons and daughters, we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who offer our full devotion, and, giving our entire minds and bodies, are able to be recognized and to have no inadequacies in front of your heart.
\n\nWe do not want heaven to give us anything material, and we do not want heaven to understand our situation, and we do not want heaven to give us grace. More than that, please allow us to know the inner heart of our father who sought to celebrate after giving that grace. And we hope to become sons and daughters who are able to call our father who has been so sorrowful, "Father," and who are able to comfort our suffering father.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to make that our goal and not mind even a difficult path; who, even if the arrows of persecution and ridicule circle around our bodies, keep sincere hearts of devotion for our father; who are able to forget all these things and go closer towards heaven, and who are able to absorb that as internal advice.
\n\nWe have prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Until now we thought that you were a being of joy surrounded by glory. We thought that you were someone who would accomplish the goal and joy of liberation for us, and that you would give us blessings and wealth and prosperity in free supply.
\n\nBut now that we see behind the situation of heaven, we have realized that there are internal complications, so that even if you want to give blessings you cannot, and we know the solemn truth that the grief filled history of sorrow of 6,000 years must be restored through indemnity. Now that we have understood that kind of situation, please allow us to become people who lament the foolishness of humankind who have not been able to do that.
\n\nPlease let us know that you are a father who is coming to this people; that you are a father who is coming to the people of the world. We have understood that those footsteps are still soaked with tears of sorrow and there still remain walls of suffering for them. Today we will become the ramparts of our father\'s suffering, and become fortresses of his sorrow.
\n\nWe will embrace our father\'s unjust suffering and grief. We must become those who know how to fight shedding blood and tears along the road of the decisive battle with the enemy in order to fulfill completely that responsibility and that mission.
\n\nFather! Please let us be moved by the heart of heaven, and please let us become people who know how to struggle and hold on to hearts of love for humankind.
\n\nWe must become people who are able to embrace your heart, and look at things with tears even when we look and mountains and streams or when looking at the people of the world.
\n\nWe must become the individuals that you want, and establish the families that you want, and centered on those families, we will have to build the world of the idea that you want. We have understood that the larger the scope of the building is, the more tears and blood will have to be shed.
\n\nWe have understood that tears have to be shed in order to find individuals, in order to find families, and in order to find the people. When we look at this path through a human perspective, it is a depressing path, it is a path of anger, it is a path of suffering. But because it is a path you have walked, we know that is a complicated course that we must go and change to a path of joy, a path of gratitude, and a path of glory.
\n\nPlease let us consider it our pride to exhaust everything we have while attending you until the last day of our lives. We earnestly hope and desire that we will become those who can run this path to the end together with you. We earnestly hope that you will let us determine once again to become those who know how to sing your praises with tears in that kind of place.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.
