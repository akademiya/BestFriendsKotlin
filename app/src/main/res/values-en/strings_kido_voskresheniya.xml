Oh Father of love!
\nPlease extend your hand and take the hands of your inadequate children and guide us. Since we have bowed down to you with united minds and bodies, Father, please take us and lead us and raise us up, and we earnestly hope and desire that you will change our minds into minds of heaven.
\n\nToday we have placed all the ideas we have about the present age before you, and since we have come before your majesty with the hearts of gentle, mild children, Father, please bring about your work of re-creation through the touch of your grace. Please reveal the fire of the Holy Spirit. Please reveal your love which has been held back and in the last days. Please open the door of the realm of death which has been blocked, and beloved Father, we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow them to be able to bring to the fore your victory and glory. If there is an empty vessel, please fill it.
\n\nPlease establish us as living children who are able to return glory to you and to be grateful, intoxicated by your ample grace. And we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us the grace of your finding us to be your children whom you can love.

My Father!
\nWe know that in the beginning you had a will of goodness and you created all the things of creation, and through the standard of your original nature you existed as an unchanging being. But because humankind could not become an object of goodness to their father who was like that, humankind could not realize your ideal for us, and we know that humankind came to face everything a long way away from the standard of a good conscience. And furthermore we know that this has been the lamentation of heaven and all the things of creation.

For us there still remains the path of providential destiny which must be found even if we have to offer our eternal lives; and since the mission remains that we must go that path until the end, please urge us to be able to go that path through your mighty omnipotence. Since elements of evil invade through our bodies and block our minds which are heading towards goodness. Oh Father, please guide us so that in this battle our minds which are heading towards goodness will not be restrained by our bodies and defeated.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will please let our minds be led only by the power of goodness and the power of love, and please let us find you and harmonize as unchanging beings; please let us resemble your external form as eternal substantiations who cannot be separated, and please hold on to us so that we may attend you eternally, Father.
\n\nFighting with evil throughout the long course of history, we have been covered with wounds, and the roots of sin have penetrated into our bones and flesh. The responsibility to remove them is ours, but since we are so inadequate, oh Father who has the power of life, oh Father who has the power of omnipotence, oh Father who has the power of re-creation, please extend your omnipotent hand one more time to our inadequate minds and bodies, and remove all the elements of evil which are holding us in the shadow of death. And we earnestly hope and desire that you will please reveal heaven's direct works of life which can raise up minds of victory stimulated by that center.
\n\nThen please raise up the power of resurrection from within us, and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to become your sons and daughters who are able to bring about the work of resurrection by representing that center in the circumstances we face.
\n\nPlease lead us so that we will not become those who lament due to being in an unsatisfactory position, and please allow us to have the qualification of being your true children by being victorious in the battle with the enemy satans who are blocking our way as we rush along the course to the position of perfection.
\n\nAnd please guide us to become sons and daughters who can be proud in front of billions of satans. And then please allow us to be able to fight and have victory over billions of satans and to carry the weapons that the heavenly forces and angels carried in their stead.

We also know that the sin of blocking the way of and violating the people who want to stand in the position of the sons and daughters you are hoping for is a greater sin than any on this earth. Violating the true sincerity of humankind is also a sin which can not be borne. But since we know that causing the true love of brothers to be lost is an even greater sin in relation heavenly morality, we earnestly hope and desire that you will guide us to become those who do not forget this.

\n\nBy representing heavenly morality, let us take responsibility for that brother as well. Please allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to prepare hidden altars. And please establish the ideal of the eternal son which you desire, and please let us realize that your gaze is always upon us.
\n\nPlease allow us to feel the touch of your love, and please allow us to hear your voice appealing to us. and we earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you will allow us to experience your heart which is aching and exhorting us, to resemble your heart, and to follow the example of your internal character, and to become the head disciples of Jesus Christ, who can be grateful bowing down to you even if we die ten million times for the Will.
\n\nFather! Please let us fight with hearts of righteous indignation and hearts for the common good representing heavenly morality, facing the many enemies who are blocking the way. Please let us go forward enduring again and again in order to offer you the day of victory. On greeting the day of victory, please allow us to be able to report to you the sorrows that we endured during that time, and please lead us so that we will be able to go until the place where we can cling to your precious hand and receive comfort.
\n\nPlease allow us to awaken all humankind who are sleeping on this earth. Since the entire world which you created is in the realm of lamentation, please mobilize us and let us restore this, and please allow to all humankind the wisdom of heaven so that all may become people of the Kingdom of Heaven by each individual fulfilling his responsibility.
\n\nPlease let us become sons and daughters who are able to go forth without minding even if it is a course of struggle. We earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become heaven's elite troops who are able to go forth for the Will alone even if we have to give up everything we have.

And we earnestly hope and desire, beloved Father, that you will restore us to being those who are able to speak out with a new voice and to appear as the original beings who have the glory of beauty in the presence of all things.
\n\nNow I have understood that my mind is not mine; I have understood that my body is not mine; and I have understood that this land where I am living is not mine. I have understood the fact that this universe is not mine, and all the things you created are not mine.

Because of the fact that we are unable to represent your entire will, please allow us to understand that today it causes you anguish that you are not able to relate to us in circumstances where you are able to establish your dignity.
\n\nPlease allow us to be able to establish your dignity now, and since you have allowed us to become those who can establish the dignity of Jesus, if there is sorrow on the earth, each of us must become those who are able to take responsibility for it ourselves. If there is suffering on the earth, please allow us to understand that each of us must take responsibility for it.
\n\nOn earth our real hearts must communicate with your mind and must communicate with Jesus mind. Please let each of us determine to take responsibility for your sorrow and difficulties and push everything aside. Since we know that we are facing a historical turning point where it will not do unless we feel the grace of your life, please allow us to have a new foundation in our minds at this time.
\n\nNow if we have not been able to have a new concept and a new heart or a standard that is able to have a relationship with you, we earnestly hope and desire that you will please allow us to realize at this time that we will not be able to avoid settling the accounts of our destiny together with the judgment of history. We know that Jesus also lived for the sake of this work, and we know that he did not live the 30 years of his life for his own sake; he lived for his people and for fallen humankind.
\n\nNow we know that the age of the Kingdom of Heaven is corning where Jesus will be able to live for himself. We know that there remains for us the final task in which it will not do unless we are allowed to receive the glory of resurrection as those who are substantiations of victory who have gone over all the peaks and valleys of the cross which Jesus went through while on the earth in order to stand as a chosen person of that age and a citizen of that nation.
\n\nIf we have come to understand this kind of content, we realize that we must bring ourselves into conformity with that reality and that will, and in order to realize the purpose of that will we must prepare a substantial sacrifice. Therefore please be with us, Father.
\n\nWe earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to become sons and daughters who are able to possess the original temple and make an altar of victory which you can recognize.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We know that the course of restoration is one that goes on and on without end, and we human beings must go in cycles over and over with grief remaining. But when we communicate with the world of heart of our father who has worked so hard, the history of sorrow which has been going in cycles comes to form a relationship with us today. The relationships of those struggles today will be able to become the foundation to constitute the destined relationships of the future. We must realize that these destined relationships of heart are those which must establish the garden of unlimited hope, unlimited joy, and unlimited longing.
\n\nWhere are the mountains and streams that you are able to be proud of as you go here and there leading Adam around? Where are the flowers that you wanted to be proud of together with Adam, and where are the growing trees, where are the green plains, and where are the flowing streams?
\n\nAdam, who could have stood in a position of going together with you in a state of being able to communicate with your heart which is like that, this Adam fell and left your side, Father. But I earnestly hope and desire, my Father, that you will allow us to become people of joy who attend our Father, whom we have longed for, and who keep you right next to us, and who know how to rejoice together with all things, together with all people, and together with the entire cosmos.
\n\nWe know that if we do not go through the loneliness and anguish of the cross which was left behind, we cannot form our destined relationship, and if we do not have minds that revere the garden of your ideal and are filled with longing, we cannot form that destined relationship. Therefore, please allow us to become sons and daughters of victory who have received your blessing and who have no relationship to the circumstances of the fall, and to become sons and daughters who are able to relate to all things in the original garden as original people who have hearts tilled with longing. And we earnestly hope and desire that you will lead us to become the true ancestors of humankind.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

We cannot help but feel that those of us who have bowed down before you have found the path of life after having wandered around here and there.
\n\nHow can we ever repay your grace of having established us in a position where we can call you, "Abba, Father," and your not having minded the endless suffering we did not even know about, and your having protected us, purified us and led us to this place?
\n\nWe don\'t have anything to repay you with. At this time we cannot help but feel that even if we give you our bodies, we cannot repay that grace; and even if we all offer you our hearts and minds, we are inadequate to raise our heads before what you have achieved through your suffering.
\n\nWe know that it is your desire and it is your situation that you who have led us to this point have the responsibility to save us and to see a day of glory through us. And when we think that you hope to find comfort through people like us, we cannot help but feel ashamed in the presence of our father who has endured the peaks and valleys of the course of history, placing your hope in our inadequate selves.
\n\nIf our flesh and blood were able to feel for your heart, and our bones were able to take on a form that could constitute a personality, then we would earnestly hope and desire, Father, that you would allow that being to be able to become a substantial form who is able to testify to your unchanging self.
\n\nHow much you must have longed for a holy, glorious being who could be part of you and return glory to you even with each and every cell. In the course of history our ancestors could not attend you in that way. We know that it is a fact of history that they followed heaven, and then at times felt resentment, and at times broke their promises, and were proud of being in the realm of the chosen people and then gave up.
\n\nFather! Since we have received this kind of grief-filled blood lineage, today we confidently say we believe heaven, but we are people who are in a position close to the evil world which is able to betray heaven tomorrow.
\n\nFather, please have compassion on us who are like this. Father, please hold on to us. We earnestly hope and desire that you will please graft your heart of life to our thirsting minds, and please carry out the work of resurrection which fills us with new life.
\n\nAlthough many people have come and gone, and even now many are coming and going, since until today there have been no people who grasped your situation and grasped your heart and wept, please allow us to become people who are able to grasp your situation and heart and weep. Please allow there to be many sons and daughters on the earth whose minds are filled with a desire to live for you and who think, "I want to attend my father," and who know how to be indignant with heaven and earth, and to be indignant with history and to be indignant with our fallen ancestors.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.

Please allow us to realize, Father, that you are not desiring any external form; you are longing for and looking for hearts and minds that adore you and that have been awakened to their original selves deep in their innermost hearts.
\n\nWhen we think about you, our father who has sought for and worked for the being of hope whom you desired while going through the course of complicated battles through the ages and through the course of history, we cannot help but feel that we did not become the "I" we are today by ourselves.
\n\nWhen we were born on the earth, we were born centered on the destined relationships of above and below, front and back, and right and left. Please allow us to understand that without our knowing it, these relationships are urging us to pursue the value of the total object or the value of a completely faultless purpose. Please allow us to realize that centered on this kind of aspect of ourselves, heaven is above us, and the history of goodness together with heavenly fortune is moving below us.
\n\nAnd please allow us to become sons and daughters who can feel that before us is the world of hope and to the right and left are our friends and people and brethren, and please allow us to seek to hold onto the original heart and be able to observe all these things and form the destined relationships of above and below, front and back, and right and left. If there are people who forget themselves completely and long for and struggle for this, even if they have walked a course of not being tolerated in their age and are opposed in their lives, we know that they will stand in front of the palace of heaven without fail in the last days.
\n\nFather, please command us now. Please speak. We are longing for and adoring your heart with our minds. Therefore, Father, if there is something that frustrates you, please let us experience it; and if something miserable and sad happens, please demonstrate it to us through our bodies. Please allow us to become sons and daughters of hope who are able to feel the reality of your existence from it being demonstrated through our bodies, and please allow us to bow down our heads and be grateful before you.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.

Today as we unworthy people come before the amazing will of our father, first we must clearly realize that we are inadequate and we must feel deep in our flesh and bones that we are fallen descendents who do not dare to stand before heaven. Whether we look here or look there, we have come to understand that we have nothing to present before heaven and be proud about.
\n\nThe blood lineage that has come from our ancestors is a lineage that has betrayed you; and even all the prophets who inherited the flesh and blood of our ancestors could not be embraced in your broad bosom of love through your heart of eternal and joyful love because they had the bitter root of sin. Therefore today we too know very well that we are people who are not proper to be approved by heaven.
\n\nWhen we come to understand the unjust fact that we beings whom you created as extremely holy are living on the earth with aspects and elements that you cannot help but dislike, we cannot help but lament bitterly. Now we vow that we must push aside, step upon, and mercilessly cut off this horrible fact that the nature of evil and the elements of evil lie latent in our flesh and blood and in every one of our cells. We cannot help but confess that we are grief-filled descendents who have not been able to form our destined relationship with your holy original nature and we could not inherit your original heart, your original lineage, or your original bones and flesh.
\n\nIn the midst of people like us, where would there be sons and daughters whom you can raise up and bless in the middle of that garden which you will leave as an eternal work? Nevertheless, please allow us to become sons and daughters who know how to bow down, lower our heads and shed tears in the presence of your mighty grace which raises our inadequate selves up to a position where we can be without sin by reducing it here and reducing it there by establishing conditions of forgiveness and conditions of approval.
\n\nThe more that we come to know heaven, we cannot help but realize that we are shameful beings in relation to you, and the further we go, we cannot help but feel fear at revealing ourselves before you with bowed heads, but we know that this is the path of following heaven. We know that your sons and daughters who have gathered here today are not appropriate to be called your sons and daughters, but even so, since we know it is your will to not cast them away, please bend down and care for us.
\n\nFather, please cover all the flaws of these people who have lived in sinister places and have been wounded. Even though they are children with whom your destined relationship of flesh and blood has been cut, still we know that through their original hearts they are in a position where you cannot say you don't know them, and therefore you seek to remember them as true children.
\n\nFather, we earnestly hope and desire that you will bless this day and remember it. 'today we are establishing this day as a new historical day; and we earnestly hope and desire that you will allow us to offer our bodies and minds and hearts to you, and that we will be able to be close to the justification of children and the glory of children.
\nAmen.

Father!
\nWe know that today is a time like the 40-year period when the people of Israel wandered and couldn\'t find their way in the wilderness, and like the time the people of Israel were struck by the rod of heaven and were consumed due to their unfaithfulness. From every aspect we look at, we know that the present is that kind of time.
\n\nFather, you are hoping for works that can cope with this kind of age, and we are also hoping for that. But if on our own we are not able to control our minds and decide the direction, and determine which way we must go, and you show us the direction we must go, we know that even if you tell us to go to that place, we will not be able to go there.
\n\nWe know that the problem is not all the things of the earth being scattered; it is the center of my mind being scattered, and having lost the direction we must go and the position we must face. We are looking at the phenomenon of the last days like that, without knowing the direction we must go and without knowing the position we must face. If we have now realized that you are the center, we will have to kneel down and bow our heads and offer devotion of our own accord in order to match the standard and position that you are hoping for.
\n\nSince we know that in the Last Days we should pour oil on our hair and go into a secret chamber and pray, please allow us to become those who establish ourselves in a position of oneness between the standard of your heart and our hearts, and find the condition of victory in our lives, and become those who discuss the value of that. If we cannot do that, please allow us to understand that we will not be able to stand in your presence.
\n\nWe are facing this kind of position, and we are watching the present situation of this kind of world and this kind of society, and our minds and bodies are suffering in this kind of environment. Therefore, please remold us since we are like this, and please establish the standard of our hearts, and please show us works centered on you, and please sanctify the center of our hearts and minds. Please sanctify our bodies and our environment and allow us to be able to be close to you.
\n\nWe have humbly prayed all these things in the name of the Lord.
\nAmen.
